@article{Staub2010a,
abstract = {It is well known that sentences containing object-extracted relative clauses (e.g., The reporter that the senator attacked admitted the error) are more difficult to comprehend than sentences containing subject-extracted relative clauses (e.g., The reporter that attacked the senator admitted the error). Two major accounts of this phenomenon make different predictions about where, in the course of incremental processing of an object relative, difficulty should first appear. An account emphasizing memory processes (Gibson, 1998; Grodner \& Gibson, 2005) predicts difficulty at the relative clause verb, while an account emphasizing experience-based expectations (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) predicts earlier difficulty, at the relative clause subject. Two eye movement experiments tested these predictions. Regressive saccades were much more likely from the subject noun phrase of an object relative than from the same noun phrase occurring within a subject relative (Experiment 1) or within a verbal complement clause (Experiment 2). This effect was further amplified when the relative pronoun that was omitted. However, reading time was also inflated on the object relative clause verb in both experiments. These results suggest that the violation of expectations and the difficulty of memory retrieval both contribute to the difficulty of object relative clauses, but that these two sources of difficulty have qualitatively distinct behavioral consequences in normal reading.},

abstract = {Three explanations for the occurrence of regressive eye movements during reading are described. Predictions are derived from one of these, the word identification explanation. These predictions are tested by analyzing a large corpus of eye movement data from 4 adult readers. The likelihood of regressing is directly related to the length of the prior saccade and to the probability the saccade skipped a word. The likelihood of regressing to a skipped word is influenced by variables that affect the perceptibility of that word. The likelihood of making inter- and intra-word regressions are often affected differently by the variables studied, indicating the importance of maintaining this distinction. The results are generally compatible with a word identification explanation of regressions during reading, though this is probably not the only basis on which regressive saccades occur.},

@article{Booth2013,
abstract = {Standard text reading involves frequent eye movements that go against normal reading order. The function of these "regressions" is still largely unknown. The most obvious explanation is that regressions allow for the rereading of previously fixated words. Alternatively, physically returning the eyes to a word's location could cue the reader's memory for that word, effectively aiding the comprehension process via location priming (the "deictic pointer hypothesis"). In Experiment 1, regression frequency was reduced when readers knew that information was no longer available for rereading. In Experiment 2, readers listened to auditorily presented text while moving their eyes across visual placeholders on the screen. Here, rereading was impossible, but deictic pointers remained available, yet the readers did not make targeted regressions in this experiment. In Experiment 3, target words in normal sentences were changed after reading. Where the eyes later regressed to these words, participants generally remained unaware of the change, and their answers to comprehension questions indicated that the new meaning of the changed word was what determined their sentence representations. These results suggest that readers use regressions to reread words and not to cue their memory for previously read words.},

abstract = {The effect of clause wrap-up on eye movements in reading was examined. Readers read passages in which a target category noun referred to either a high typical or a low typical antecedent. In addition, the category noun was either clause final or non-clause final. There were four primary results: (1) Readers looked longer at a category noun when its antecedent was a low typical member of the category than when it was a high typical member; (2) readers looked longer at the category noun and at the post-category region when they were clause final than when they were not clause final; (3) readers regressed from a category noun or post-category region more frequently when it was clause final than when it was not clause final; and (4) readers made longer initial saccades when their eyes left the category noun or post-category region when this word was in clause final position than when it was not clause final. The last result suggests that sometimes higher order processes that are related to making a decision about when to move the eyes impinge on lower level decisions that are typically associated with deciding where to move the eyes.},

@book{Chomsky1986,
abstract = {This monograph explores several complex questions concerning the theories of government and bounding, including, in particular, the possibility of a unified approach to these topics. Starting with the intuitive idea that certain categories in certain configurations are barriers to government and movement, it considers whether the same categories are barriers in the two instances or whether one barrier suffices to block government (a stricter and "more local" relation) while more than one barrier inhibits movement, perhaps in a graded manner. Any proposal concerning the formulation of the concept of government has intricate consequences, and many of the empirical phenomena that appear to be relevant are still poorly understood. Similarly, judgments about the theory of movement also involve a number of different factors, including sensitivity to lexical choice. Therefore, Chomsky proceeds on the basis of speculations as to the proper idealization of complex phenomena - how they should be sorted into a variety of interacting systems (some of which remain quite obscure), which may tentatively be put aside to be explained by independent (sometimes unknown) factors, and which may be considered relevant to the subsystems under investigation.Barriers considers several possible paths through the maze of possibilities that arise. It sets the subtheory context (x-bar theory, theory of movement, and government) for determining what constitutes a barrier and explores two concepts of barrier - maximal projection and the minimality condition - and their manifestations in and implications for proper government, subjacency, island violations, vacuous movement, parasitic gaps, and A-chains.

abstract = {The integration of visual, lexical, and oculomotor information is a critical part of reading. Mr. Chips is an ideal-observer model that combines these sources of information optimally to read simple texts in the minimum number of saccades. In the model, the concept of the visual span (the number of letters that can be identified in a single fixation) plays a key, unifying role. The behavior of the model provides a computational framework for reexamining the literature on human reading saccades. Emergent properties of the model, such as regressive saccades and an optimal-viewing position, suggest new interpretations of human behavior. Because Mr. Chip's "retina" can have any (one-dimensional) arrangement of high-resolution regions and scotomas, the model can simulate common visual disorders. Surprising saccade strategies are linked to the pattern of scotomas. For example, Mr. Chips sometimes plans a saccade that places a decisive letter in a scotoma. This article provides the first quantitative model of the effects of scotomas on reading.},

Mr. Chips is an ideal-observer model that combines these sources of information optimally to read simple texts in the minimum number of saccades. This model provides a computational framework for interpreting human reading saccades in both normal and low vision. The purpose of this paper is to report performance of the model for conditions emulating reading with normal vision––a visual span of nine characters, multiplicative saccade noise with a standard deviation of 30\%, and texts based on three full-length children's books. Comparison of fixation locations by humans and Mr. Chips revealed: (1) that both exhibit very similar word-skipping behavior; (2) both show initial fixations near the center of words, but with a systematic difference suggestive of an asymmetry in the human visual span; and (3) differences in the pattern of refixations within words that may uncover non-optimal lexical inference by human readers. A human context effect––30\% difference in mean saccade size between continuous text and random sequences of words––was very similar to the 25\% effect for the model associated with a corresponding difference in the predictability of text words. Overall, our findings show that many of the complicated aspects of human reading saccades can be explained concisely by early information-processing constraints.},

abstract = {This paper describes an interactive activation model of eye movement control in reading, Glenmore, that can account within one mechanism for preview and spillover effects, for regressions, progressions, and refixations. The model decouples the decision about when to move the eyes from the word recognition process. The time course of activity in a "fixate centre" determines the triggering of a saccade. The other main feature of the model is the use of a saliency map that acts as an arena for the interplay of bottom-up visual features of the text, and top-down lexical features. These factors combine to create a pattern of. activation that selects one word as the saccade target. Even within the relatively simple framework proposed here, a coherent account has been provided for a range of eye movement control phenomena that have hitherto proved problematic to reconcile.},

@article{Bartek2011,
abstract = {Many comprehension theories assert that increasing the distance between elements participating in a linguistic relation (e.g., a verb and a noun phrase argument) increases the difficulty of establishing that relation during on-line comprehension. Such locality effects are expected to increase reading times and are thought to reveal properties and limitations of the short-term memory system that supports comprehension. Despite their theoretical importance and putative ubiquity, however, evidence for on-line locality effects is quite narrow linguistically and methodologically: It is restricted almost exclusively to self-paced reading of complex structures involving a particular class of syntactic relation. We present 4 experiments (2 self-paced reading and 2 eyetracking experiments) that demonstrate locality effects in the course of establishing subject-verb dependencies; locality effects are seen even in materials that can be read quickly and easily. These locality effects are observable in the earliest possible eye-movement measures and are of much shorter duration than previously reported effects. To account for the observed empirical patterns, we outline a processing model of the adaptive control of button pressing and eye movements. This model makes progress toward the goal of eliminating linking assumptions between memory constructs and empirical measures in favor of explicit theories of the coordinated control of motor responses and parsing.

abstract = {Eye movements were recorded as subjects read sentences containing temporary structural ambiguities. In accord with the garden-path theory of sentence comprehension, shorter reading times were found for sentences conforming to certain independently motivated parsing strategies (late closure and minimal attachment) than for comparable sentences which violate these strategies. Further, longer fixation durations were associated with the very first fixation in the region of the sentence which disambiguated the sentence, suggesting that the human sentence-parsing mechanism operates in a rather systematic fashion, immediately computing the structural consequences of fixated material for the analysis of preceding material. The pattern of regressive eye movements did not conform to the view that the parsing mechanism automatically returns to the beginning of the sentence to revise an incorrect analysis of linguistic material nor did it support the view that the parsing mechanism systematically backtracks through the sentence until the source of the erroneous analysis is located. Rather, the pattern of regressions indicated that the parsing mechanism typically engages in selective reanalysis, exploiting whatever information it has available about the type of error it has committed to guide its reanalysis attempts. Finally, it is emphasized that an understanding of the parser's revision procedures is essential to an explanation of why certain linguistic structures cannot be successfully parsed by humans.},

abstract = {The understanding of the control of eye movements has greatly benefited from the analysis of mathematical models. Currentlymost comprehensive models include sequential shifts of visual attention. Here we propose an alternative model of eye movementcontrol, which includes three new principles: spatially distributed lexical processing, a separation of saccade timing from saccadetarget selection, and autonomous (random) generation of saccades with foveal inhibition. These three features provide a commoncontrol mechanism for fixations, refixations, and regressions. Consequently, the model is called SWIFT (Saccade-generation withinhibition by foveal targets). Results from numerical simulations are in good agreement with effects of word frequency on single-fixation, first-fixation, and gaze durations as well as fixation and word skipping probabilities in first-pass analysis. The modelinherently produces complex eye movement patterns including refixations and regressions due to its underlying dynamical principles.},

abstract = {In 3 experiments, the author examined how readers’ eye movements are influenced by joint manipulations of a word’s frequency and the syntactic fit of the word in its context. In the critical conditions of the first 2 experiments, a high- or low-frequency verb was used to disambiguate a garden-path sentence, while in the last experiment, a high- or low-frequency verb constituted a phrase structure violation. The frequency manipulation always influenced the early eye movement measures of first-fixation duration and gaze duration. The context manipulation had a delayed effect in Experiment 1, influencing only the probability of a regressive eye movement from later in the sentence. However, the context manipulation influenced the same early eye movement measures as the frequency effect in Experiments 2 and 3, though there was no statistical interaction between the effects of these variables. The context manipulation also influenced the probability of a regressive eye movement from the verb, though the frequency manipulation did not. These results are shown to confirm predictions emerging from the serial, staged architecture for lexical and integrative processing of the E–Z Reader 10 model of eye movement control in reading (Reichle, Warren, \& McConnell, 2009). It is argued, more generally, that the results provide an important constraint on how the relationship between visual word recognition and syntactic attachment is treated in processing models. },

This result is consistent with the predictions of several theories (Gibson, 2000; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005), and contradicts the recent claim (Levy, 2008) that in relative-clause structures increasing argument-verb distance makes processing easier at the verb. Levy’s expectation-based account predicts that the expectation for a verb becomes sharper as distance is increased and therefore processing becomes easier at the verb. We argue that, in addition to expectation effects (which are seen in the eyetracking study in first-pass regression probability), processing load also increases with increasing distance. This contradicts Levy’s claim that heightened expectation leads to lower processing cost. Dependency- resolution cost and expectation-based facilitation are jointly responsible for determining processing cost.},

abstract = {This paper presents the cue-based retrieval theory of parsing and reanalysis and illustrates how this account can accommodate a number of key results about parsing and reanalysis, including effects due to structure, distance, and type of structural change. Three offline experiments and one online experiment permit establishing the locus of these effects as due to properties of the initial parsing processes or to the repair mechanism. Specifically, the data reported here suggest that a structural factor specific to the operation of the parser, retrieval interference, affects attachment uniformly across ambiguous and unambiguous sentences and serves to create a limit on successful repair. In addition, these experiments suggest that distance of the head of an ambiguous phrase from its disambiguator affects repair processes-and not attachment processes-independently of the interference effect. These results are interpreted with respect to alternative models of reanalysis, which are contrasted with the cue-based retrieval account, which requires no distinct repair mechanism to account for the current results. A further contribution of this article is to suggest a statistical correction for individual variance in reading rates. Statistical analyses on individual subject data confirmed previous speculations regarding a possible increase in reading rates as subjects move through a sentence. While this individual variation limits fair comparisons of reading times in sentence regions that appear in non-identical serial positions, we demonstrate that such comparisons become meaningful when the appropriate regression analyses have been performed.},

abstract = {Phillips, Wagers \& Lau (2009) have claimed that reflexives in English are immune to interference from structurally inaccessible antecedents because antecedents are retrieved using only structural cues without considering the person, gender and number features. The support for this claim is derived from studies (eg. Nicol \& Swinney 1989, Sturt 2003 and Xiang, Dillon, \& Phillips 2009) which found either no effect of interference or a late effect. However, the absence of effect in these studies can be attributed to different factors like lack of statistical power, absence of a critical condition and lack of temporal resolution in the methodology. We present a computational model based on the principles of the cue-based retrieval theory (Lewis \& Vasishth, 2005) which predicts an interference effect in reflexive binding. We also report an eye-tracking study that confirms the predictions. The simulations predict the interference effect in terms of: (i) processing time at the reflexive, which includes antecedent retrieval time and (ii) percentage of errors in the retrieval of the grammatical antecedent for the reflexive. Prediction (ii) matches the error rates in Sturt (2003) and our web-based replication of the same study. In the eye-tracking study (n=40) we found an early effect of interference from the inaccessible antecedent in terms of first-pass regression probability-- a gender match between the reflexive and the inaccessible NP induced a significantly higher (p=0.04) number of first-pass regressions from the reflexive in the sentence. The effect of a gender match with the grammatical antecedent was observed only in late eye-tracking measures. In sum, this work (i) challenges the claim that the antecedent of a reflexive is accessed using only structural cues, and shows that the interference induced by the intervening noun occurs very early during dependency resolution, and (ii) presents an implemented computational model that predicts the interference effect.},

abstract = {When people read temporarily ambiguous sentences, there is often an
increased prevalence of regressive eye-movements launched from the
word that resolves the ambiguity. Traditionally, such regressions
have been interpreted at least in part as reflecting readers’ efforts
to re-read and reconfigure earlier material, as exemplified by the
Selective Reanalysis hypothesis [Frazier, L., \& Rayner, K. (1982).
Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements
in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences. Cognitive Psychology,
14, 178–210]. Within such frameworks it is assumed that the selection
of saccadic landing-sites is linguistically supervised. As an alternative
to this proposal, we consider the possibility (dubbed the Time Out
hypothesis) that regression control is partly decoupled from linguistic
operations and that landing-sites are instead selected on the basis
of low-level spatial properties such as their proximity to the point
from which the regressive saccade was launched. Two eye-tracking
experiments were conducted to compare the explanatory potential of
these two accounts. Experiment 1 manipulated the formatting of linguistically
identical sentences and showed, contrary to purely linguistic supervision,
that the landing site of the first regression from a critical word
was reliably influenced by the physical layout of the text. Experiment
2 used a fixed physical format but manipulated the position in the
display at which reanalysis-relevant material was located. Here the
results showed a highly reliable linguistic influence on the overall
distribution of regression landing sites (though with few effects
being apparent on the very first regression). These results are interpreted
as reflecting mutually exclusive forms of regression control with
fixation sequences being influenced both by spatially constrained,
partially decoupled supervision systems as well as by some kind of
linguistic guidance. The findings are discussed in relation to existing
computational models of eye-movements in reading.},

abstract = {To examine the nature of the information that guides eye movements to previously read text during reading (regressions), we used a relatively novel technique to request a regression to a particular target word when the eyes reached a predefined location during sentence reading. A regression was to be directed to a close or a distant target when either the first or the second line of a complex two-line sentence was read. In addition, conditions were created that pitted effects of spatial and linguistic distance against each other. Initial regressions were more accurate when the target was spatially near, and effects of spatial distance dominated effects of verbal distance. Initial regressions rarely moved the eyes onto the target, however, and subsequent "corrective' regressions that homed in on the target were subject to general linguistic processing demands, being more accurate during first-line reading than during second-line reading. The results suggest that spatial and verbal memory guide regressions in reading. Initial regressions are primarily guided by fixation-centered spatial memory, and corrective regressions are primarily guided by linguistic knowledge.},

while reading a follow-up word. They have to move their gaze back to the word the hear. Sentences to-be-read extended over two lines. 

        

        
In half of the conditions [Subexp 1], regessions were initiated from the end of the first or second line, and the distance to the target was manipulated.
Conditions:
* Regression distance (long/short) x Regression domain (first/second line)

        

        
PREDICTIONS:
(Very questionable predictions)
* If verbal knowledge is used to infer location, accuracy should be lower on the second line, due to higher "verbal load", and thus higher interference. There should be no difference if spatial coordinates are stored, because they are much more implicit.
They relate it to a Miyake et al. (1994) paper, which seems to discuss something along the lines of digging in effects.
[I guess I agree with the general idea of storage=spatial vs. reconstruction=verbal. Higher load+reconstruction should really lead to worse performance.]

        

        

        

        
In another half of the conditions [Subexp 2], regressions were started from the beginning of the second line. Verbal and spatial distance were dissociated, or rather always mismatched. Sometimes the first line was masked with random characters, before the probe was presented.
Conditons:
* spatial close, verbal far \{\&\} spatial far, verbal close x mask/no mask

        

        

        

        
RESULTS:
- Measures of interest: Regression size and (absolute) accuracy.

        

        
Regression Size:
* Initial Regressions: Main effect of distance (longer saccades with increasing distance), but no effect of line and no interaction.
* Cumulative Regressions: Main effect of distance, and interaction between distance and line. The interaction is caused by a larger effect of distance in the first line.
==> No effect in initial but then an effect in cumulative size. 
According to W\{\&\}I there is spatial adressing, but then finer verbal 
guidance.

        

        
Regression Accuracy:
* Initial Regressions: Main effect of distance, and marginal main effect of line: Accuracy slightly higher in first line than second line (p=.08). No interaction.
* Cumulative Regressions: Main effect of distance, main effect of line (better accuracy in first line.) No interaction.

Regressions do not produce the experience of a "word salad", even though the temporal order of words is mixed up. Readers are often not even aware of having regressed.
-> Inconsistencies between temporal and spatial word order need to be resolved. [Or: Temporal order needs to be ignored while spatial order is perceived.]

        
Kennedy et al. (2003): Exp
Readers were asked a question about a sentence which either remained on the screen durng the question or not. In 13\% and 50\% of the trials respectively, readers regressed *toward* the relevant word.
In both conditions, *if* a regression was executed, the eyes moved ver close to the target word. 
[I hope this does not mean that they re-read the sentence]
=> Readers have a spatial memory for words. But could be verbal, too.

        
Inhoff \{\&\} Weger (2005):
Similar results, but regressions were quite imprecise, and precision was less accurate when the distance was longer. Again the data is compatible with coarse spatial info or location reconstruction based on verbal info.

abstract = {In English, integration of an argument with its head generally leads to slower comprehension at the head (e.g., verb), the more material intervenes between the two. Such “locality” effects have been interpreted as evidence for memory-based comprehension accounts. Most memory-based comprehension accounts are, however, challenged by cases where more intervening material facilitates processing. Such “anti-locality” effects are often interpreted as evidence for expectation-based processing. An alternative interpretation of anti-locality effects within a memory-based account is proposed in (Lewis, Vasishth, \& Van Dyke, 2006): intervening material can lead to repeated retrieval and hence reactivation of dependents. This reactivation can counteract activation-decay and lead to faster retrieval of the dependents at the head. We present new evidence of anti-locality from English relative clauses that existing memory-based accounts, including Lewis et al., 2006, cannot explain. We argue that memory-based and expectation-based models need to be integrated in order to account for the existence of locality and anti-locality effects. We also introduce a two-step mixed effect analysis of reading time data that incorporates controls for several potential confounds common in experiments that investigate locality and anti-locality effects.},

Severalinfluential eye-tracking studies on syntactic reanalysis (Frazier \& Rayner, 1982; Meseguer,Carreiras, \& Clifton, 2002; Mitchell, Shen, Green, \& Hodgson, 2008) have addressed thisquestion by examining scanpaths, i.e., sequential patterns of eye fixations. However, in theabsence of a suitable method for analyzing scanpaths, these studies relied on simplifieddependent measures that are arguably ambiguous and hard to interpret. We address thetheoretical question of repair strategy by developing a new method that quantifiesscanpath similarity. Our method reveals several distinct fixation strategies associated withreanalysis that went undetected in a previously published data set (Meseguer et al., 2002).One prevalent pattern suggests re-parsing of the sentence, a strategy that has beendiscussed in the literature (Frazier \& Rayner, 1982); however, readers differedtremendously in how they orchestrated the various fixation strategies. Our results suggestthat the human parsing system non-deterministically adopts different strategies whenconfronted with the disambiguating material in garden-path sentences.},

With respect to the relation between shifts of attention and saccadic eye movements, several experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to dissociate the line of attention from the gaze direction. On the other hand, there is some indirect (although not yet conclusive) evidence that saccadic eye movements always produce a concomitant shift of attention. Another question is whether there is a moment-to-moment control of each consecutive saccade and latency or whether indirect control models (i.e. planning several saccades in advance) are more appropriate. The function of attentional processes which have to coordinate stimulus driven (bottom-up) and concept driven (top-down) mechanisms are discussed and related to some studies investigating local and global scanpaths.},

This paper contends that the theoretical and empirical basis for such approaches is weak. A conceptually simpler alternative is that the processor reprocesses (some portion of) the input using just those structure-building operations available in first-pass parsing. This reprocessing is a necessary component of any realistic processing model. By contrast, the structural revisions required for second-pass repair are more powerful than warranted by the abilities of the first-pass parser. This paper also reviews experimental evidence for repair presented by Sturt, Pickering, and Crocker (1999). We demonstrate that the Sturt et. al. findings are consistent with a reprocessing account and present a self-paced reading experiment intended to tease apart the repair and reprocessing accounts. The results support a reprocessing interpretation of Sturt et. al.'s data, rendering a repair-based explanation superfluous.},

abstract = {In an eye movement experiment, we examined the use of reanalysis strategies during the reading of locally ambiguous but globally unambiguous Spanish sentences. Among other measures, we examined regressive eye movements made while readers were recovering in reading mild garden path sentences. The sentences had an adverbial clause that, depending on the mood (indicative vs. subjunctive) of the subordinate clause verb, could attach high (to the main verb of the sentence) or low (to the verb in the subordinate clause). Although Spanish speakers favor low attachment, the high attachment version was quite easy to understand. Readers predominately used two alternative strategies to recover from the mild garden path in our sentences. In the more common reanalysis strategy, their eyes regressed from the last region (disambiguation+ 1) directly to the main verb in the sentence. Following this, they reread the rest of the sentence, fixating the next region and the adverb (the beginning of the ambiguous part of the sentence). Less frequently, readers regressed from the last region (disambiguation+1) directly to the adverb. We argue that both types of strategies are consistent with a selective reanalysis process as described by Frazier and Rayner (1982).},

very different mechanisms for the generation of saccades to previous

We show that the results are contrary to the predictions of a number
of accounts, and provide new evidence to discriminate among the models.},
