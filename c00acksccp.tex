\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

The following researchers made important contributions to the  computational modelling presented in this book, during the time that they were doing their PhD or postdoctoral research with the first author.
\begin{itemize}
\item Ms.\ Paula Liss{\'o}n was the lead on the aphasia modeling work on the comparison of the models of retrieval processes in aphasia \citep{LissonEtAl2020}.
\item Ms.\ Dorothea Pregla developed the German data-set on individuals with aphasia and  controls as part of her PhD dissertation; in future work, these will serve as benchmark tests for the models discussed in this book.
\item Ms.\ Daniela Mertzen carried out several large-sample experiments on interference as part of her PhD dissertation work \citep{MertzenEtAlAMLaP2019}.  
\item Mr.\ Himanshu Yadav, Dr.\ Garrett Smith, and Dr.\ Dario Paape: helped develop extensions of the approximate Bayesian Computation approach  reported here. 
\item Dr.\ Garrett Smith developed the new principled approach for determining lexical features \citep{smith2019smithvasishthfeatures}. 
\item Prof.\ Dr.\  Lena J\"ager: Co-authored the meta-analysis \citep{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017} that forms the empirical basis for some of the model evaluations reported in this book, and co-developed the prominence and multi-associative cues extension of the core model, as reported in \cite{EngelmannJaegerVasishth2019}.
\item Prof.\ Dr.\  Bruno  Nicenboim: Developed the implementation of the direct-access model, as reported in \cite{NicenboimRetrieval2018}.
 \item Dr.\ Titus von der Malsburg: Provided the empirical  basis for  modelling underspecification and reanalysis \citep{MalsburgVasishth2013}, as discussed in chapter~\ref{c04}.
 \item Mr.\ Paul M\"atzig: Carried out the model development and simulations reported in \cite{MaetzigEtAltopics2018}.
 \item Prof.\ Dr.\ Pavel Loga{\v c}ev implemented and tested several models relating to attachment ambiguities and underspecification \citep{LogacevMultiple,LogacevVasishthQJEP2016}. 
 \item Dr.\ Umesh Patil: Carried out the model development and simulations reported in \cite{PatilEtAl2016}.

This book was generously funded by the Volkswagen Foundation through an \textit{Opus Magnum} award (grant number 89 953) to Shravan Vasishth. The grant  allowed the first author to take a two-year sabbatical from teaching to concentrate on research and writing. Shravan Vasishth also thanks his wife and son for their patience  with him over the last few years.
