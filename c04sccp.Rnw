\section{Incorporating prominence and multi-associative cues}

Here, we introduce two new constructs that could in principle explain facilitatory interference in target-match conditions and inhibitory interference in target-mismatch conditions. These two constructs are  prominence and cue-confusion.\footnote{This chapter is reused (with minor changes in wording) with permission from \cite{EngelmannJaegerVasishth2019}, Copyright (2019) Wiley; license numbers 4736530410746 (text), and 4736591287981 (figures and table).}

\end{figure}

We reconsider three assumptions in the ACT-R based cue-based retrieval model that constitutes the basis of the LV05 predictions. These are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The base-level activation of items in memory is a function only of decay and reactivation through study-relevant retrieval events. Other influences (discussed in detail below) are usually ignored.
  \item The fan effect (the inhibitory interference effect caused by cue overload) is a function of the number of items that match a specific retrieval cue, independent of their activation.
  \item The associative strength between a retrieval cue and a memory item is based on a binary (match/mismatch) one-to-one mapping between the cue and a feature value.
\end{enumerate}

These assumptions are, in fact, oversimplifications that do not accurately reflect general aspects of cognition. 
In particular, considering that the memory activation of an item represents its strength of representation or its accessibility, it should (a) affect the strength of interference, and (b) take into account more aspects of the linguistic context than only the retrieval event that is relevant in a particular experiment. 
Furthermore, given that cognitive associations between contextual cues and certain representation are the result of associative learning through experience, 
one should account for the fact that these associations can be graded and multi-associative in nature and are not necessarily strictly categorical.
Motivated by these considerations, the revised assumptions we propose are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[1$'$.] The base-level activation of items in memory (i.e., accessibility) is affected by --- in addition to recency --- their \textbf{prominence} in the current context, i.e., their  relevance/salience in terms of syntactic relations in a sentence or information-structural and discourse properties.
  \item[2$'$.] The strength of any interference effect --- including the fan effect --- is not simply a function of presence vs.\ absence of a distractor but changes as a function of the distractor's activation in memory relative to the target.
  \item[3$'$.] The associative strength between a retrieval cue and a memory item can be the result of multiple cues being associated with multiple features at variable degrees. \textbf{Cue-feature associations} are based on associative learning through language experience. 
\end{enumerate}

In the following two sections, we show how the revised assumptions change the prediction space of LV05 and how this compares to the empirical evidence. 
We begin with an investigation of the way that different levels of distractor prominence can change the predictions (revised assumption 1$'$), assuming that relative activation affects the strength of the fan effect (revised assumption 2$'$).


\subsection{Item prominence}
\label{sec:prominence}

The activation of a noun in memory prior to being retrieved (its base-level activation) is usually considered a function of the time since it is encountered in the sentence (cf.\ Equation~\ref{eq:bl}). 
However, whether it was introduced as a subject or an object might change the way the noun is maintained in memory. Similarly, if a noun has been introduced in a context sentence previously may affect its memory representation.
Indeed, independent evidence shows that the accessibility of a noun phrase is increased in prominent grammatical positions or through increased discourse saliency, \revised{such as being the discourse topic} \citep{Ariel1990,Arnold2007,  Brennan1995, Chafe1976, DuBois2003, GroszJoshiWeinstein1995,KeenanComrie1977}.
It is plausible that items which have a high prominence by virtue of their grammatical or discourse status are retrieved intermittently or maintained with high activation in memory. This implies that their base-level activation is higher than that of less prominent items due to reactivation boosts and reduced decay.
More prominent items would thus have an elevated activation level prior to retrieval and will therefore --- other things being equal --- be retrieved with higher probability and lower latency than items with lower prominence.
In the same way, prominence could include other factors that we do not consider here: For example, thematic role \citep{Arnold2001}, contrastive focus \citep{CowlesWalenskiKluender2007}, first mention \citep{GernsbacherHargreaves1988}, and animacy \citep{FukumuraVanGompel2011} are known to affect discourse saliency and might thus influence an items activation in memory. 
We focus here on the effects of grammatical position and discourse status, which have been discussed in the literature on memory interference in dependency resolution \citep{VanDykeMcElree2011,CunningsFelser2013,PatilVasishthLewis2016,Sturt2003}.

In the model, instead of modeling each additional hypothesized retrieval or reactivation event, we simply add a term to the base-level activation that is a function of the grammatical role or discourse status of the memory item.
% In other words, a prominent item is more \emph{salient} or more \emph{accessible} in memory than a low-prominence item and this should influence the interference effect during retrieval.
Because of our revised assumption 2$'$, according to which the magnitude of the interference caused by a distractor in the model depends on its activation relative to the target, a sentence containing a high-prominence distractor should show a different interference effect than a sentence with a low-prominence distractor, even if the target and the retrieval cues are the same.
Expressed in ACT-R terms, a high prominence status results in an increased \emph{base-level activation} $B_{i}$, which is the activation of an item before \emph{spreading activation} $S_{i}$ is added as the result of the retrieval cues.

The figure clearly shows a non-linear relationship between distractor prominence and the interference effects in target-match and target-mismatch configurations.

%% to-do add
We first look at the predictions for \emph{target-mismatch} configurations (broken line), as these are less complex than the target-match predictions.

\subsubsection{Predictions in target-mismatch configurations}\label{promexpl}
Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew} shows a facilitatory interference effect that first increases then decreases with increasing distractor prominence.
% Recall that the interference effect in target-mismatch configurations is caused solely by a race process between two similarly activated items. Because no features are overlapping between the items, no fan effect is predicted and, hence, no inhibitory interference is predicted. 
% , which also reflect the proportion of retrieving the target vs.\ the distractor across multiple iterations
\revVI{In order to understand the causes for the behavior of the model, it is important to be clear about how Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew} was generated: 
(i) The interference effect shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew} is the latency difference between the interference condition (when the distractor matches one of the retrieval cues) and the no-interference condition (when the distractor does not match the retrieval cues). The interference effect therefore reflects how distractor prominence affects both these conditions.
(ii) The effects shown are computed from mean retrieval latencies per condition across multiple trials. 
(iii) The latency values in each trial are a function of the activation value of only the most activated (hence, retrieved) item, which can be either the target or the distractor. Hence, the mean latency in each condition reflects a mix of target and distractor activation values.}
(iv) The distractor in the no-interference condition is always less activated than the distractor in the interference condition, because the latter matches one of the retrieval cues and therefore receives spreading activation.
(v) Without differences in base-level activation between target and distractor, the interference effect in target-mismatch configurations is caused solely by \emph{statistical facilitation} due to a race process between two similarly activated items \citep{LogacevVasishth2015,raab1962division}.
This is the case for the predictions of the original LV05 model, which are equivalent to the situation of equal prominence between target and distractor, as represented by the vertical line in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew}. 
\revVI{Note that, further to the right of the LV05 line, facilitatory effects are caused less by statistical facilitation but mainly by a difference in base-level activations due to distractor prominence.}
Figure~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch} in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendixProm} provides a graphical summary of the main observations and their underlying causes in target-mismatch configurations. 
\revIV{The following is a summary of the mechanisms we explain in detail below (the enumeration corresponds to the markers in Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}):}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[(a)] low interference due to low prominence
 	\item[(b)] equivalent to LV05 when distractor prominence is $0$
 	\item[(c)] maximal facilitatory interference due to misretrievals at maximal latency difference between conditions
 	\item[(d)] low interference due to individual latencies being close to zero
\end{enumerate}

At LV05 equivalence (vertical line in Fig.~\ref{fig:prominenceNew} and point b in Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}), the activation level of target and distractor in the interference condition is equal (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.1). Therefore, both have equal retrieval probability (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.2), leading to \revIV{a race situation with} faster retrievals on average due to statistical facilitation (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.3) and, hence, a facilitatory interference effect (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.4).
To the left of the LV05 equivalence, the distractor has lower activation than the target and is thus retrieved less often, hence (a) the statistical facilitation is smaller.\footnote{
  As discussed in \cite{LogacevVasishth2015}, facilitation in a race process is largest when the two racing processes have similar completion times.} 
To the right of the LV05 equivalence, the distractor becomes more activated than the target and, similarly, the statistical facilitation becomes smaller because of different completion times between target and distractor. Despite this, however, the facilitation effect in target-mismatch keeps increasing. This is because the \emph{distractor} is now much more activated and has a higher retrieval probability than the target in the \emph{interference condition}, while the \revIV{\emph{target} is still more active and more likely to be retrieved in the \emph{no-interference condition} because of its better match with the retrieval cues} (Fig.~~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.2). Hence, the average retrieval latency is lower in the interference condition (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.3) due to more \revIV{fast misretrievals of the highly activated distractor}. 
At the maximal facilitatory interference effect around $p_{dstr}=0.9$ (point c in Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}), the retrieval probability of the distractor in the interference condition approaches 100\% while being just under 40\% in the no-interference condition (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.2). 
\revIV{This means that the mean latency in the interference condition is 100\% caused by fast misretrievals of the highly activated distractor, while, in the no-interference condition, the mean latency is still mostly influenced by target retrievals.}
This maximizes the mean latency difference between the conditions (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.3) and therefore the interference effect (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.4). 
\revIV{After point c, the retrieval probability of the distractor in the no-interference condition surpasses that of the target, giving the distractor more influence on the mean retrieval latencies, such that the retrieval latency receives a sharper decrease as a function of distractor prominence (broken line in Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.3).
Therefore, the retrieval speed in the no-interference condition starts catching up with that in the interference condition, where the latency decreases more slowly because the amount of misretrievals --- and therefore the influence of the highly activated distractor --- in the interference condition is staying constant (at 100\%).
Because the retrieval latency becomes more similar in both conditions, we see a decreasing interference effect.}
Above $p_{dstr}=2$, the distractor is so highly activated that it is retrieved in every iteration in both the interference and no-interference conditions (d). At this point, the only difference between both conditions is the constant activation boost for the distractor due to the cue match in the interference condition (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.1). Further increasing distractor prominence affects both conditions in the same way.
% , such that the latency difference remains constant and the facilitation effect cannot increase any further.
% The race effect is maximal when distractor and target are equally activated. Equal activation of target and distractor arises when the prominence difference is zero.
% However, independently of the race effect, the facilitation in target-mismatch increases even further as distractor prominence increases. This is because the proportion of retrieving the highly activated distractor is also increasing, thus lowering the average retrieval latency.
\revVI{As activation goes to infinity with increasing prominence, retrieval latencies in both conditions asymptote to zero (see ACT-R latency equation \ref{eq:rt}). Therefore, the facilitation effect also decreases further towards zero (see Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMismatch}.3).}
}


\revFE{
\subsubsection{Predictions in target-match configurations}
We now turn to \emph{target-match} configurations (the solid line in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew}), where we see a more complex pattern than in target-mismatch configurations:
The inhibitory target-match interference effect \emph{increases} with increasing distractor activation, and \emph{decreases} when the distractor activation exceeds the target activation, eventually turning into a \emph{facilitatory interference effect}, which later decreases again.
In explaining this pattern, we refer to Figure~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch} in Appendix~\ref{sec:appendixProm}, which highlights six points of interest along the curve:

\begin{enumerate}
 		\item[(a)] low interference due to low prominence
 		\item[(b)] maximal inhibitory interference effect due to increased fan
 		\item[(c)] equal activation of target and distractor in interference condition: lower fan effect due to statistical facilitation
 		\item[(d)] zero interference effect because of equal strength of fan effect and facilitation due to misretrievals of the highly-activated distractor
 		\item[(e)] maximal facilitatory interference effect due to misretrievals
 		\item[(f)] low interference due to latencies being close to zero.
\end{enumerate}

To the left of the LV05-equivalence line in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew}, the target-match interference effect increases with increasing prominence (a) because the new fan equation in the extended model (see Eq.~\ref{eq:newfan} in the implementation below) takes into account the activation of each distractor item instead of only the number of distractors.
The inhibitory interference effect is maximal at (b) just before the distractor activation value approaches that of the target (see Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}.1), when a statistical facilitation effect begins to arise due to a race between both items. The statistical facilitation is maximal when distractor activation and target activation are equal in the interference condition (c). At this point, the inhibitory effect is reduced because the statistical facilitation counteracts the fan effect. 
Beyond the point of equal activation between target and distractor, the statistical facilitation decreases again. However, the facilitatory effect continues to increase and counteract the fan effect because now the retrieval probability of the distractor is higher than that of the target (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}.2) and, hence, the mean retrieval latency in the interference condition (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}.3) reflects the increasingly activated distractor. 
When the strength of the facilitation equals that of the fan effect, the interference effect is zero (d). At this point, the activation of the distractor in the interference condition equals the activation of the target in the no-interference condition (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}.1). Because the distractor is the most retrieved item in the interference condition while the target is still the most retrieved item in the no-interference condition, Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}.2, the mean retrieved latency is the same in both conditions (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}.3).
As the activation and retrieval probability of the distractor in the interference condition keep increasing, the mean retrieval latency is now lower in the interference condition than in the no-interference condition (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}.3), leading to a facilitatory interference effect (Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}.4). 
From here, the pattern and its explanation are the same as in target-mismatch configurations. The facilitatory effect reaches its maximum when the retrieval probability for the distractor in the interference condition is 100\% and the distractor's activation and probability in the no-interference condition are also about to surpass the target's (point e in Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}.1-3). The latency difference between the conditions, and thereby the effect, keep decreasing while the retrieval probabilities of the highly-activated distractor become more similar in both conditions, and additionally, because the latencies approach zero with very high prominence values (f).
}

% There is some evidence in the literature that points towards effects of prominence, specifically in target-match configurations. 
% concentrate on the evidence that bears on the predictions for target-match configurations.

\revisedII{How do these predictions match up with the data?}
In the literature on target-match interference configurations with high-prominence distractors, there is some evidence for both (A) inhibitory effects as well as (B) facilitatory effects. 
For the remainder of this section, we summarize this evidence in comparison with the predictions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew}.


\paragraph{A: Target-match inhibition}
In an eyetracking and a speed-accuracy trade-off experiment with target-match configurations, \cite{VanDykeMcElree2011} found that a distractor noun phrase in the subject position of a subordinate clause, such as \textit{the witness} (vs.\ \textit{motion}) in \ref{ex:vandyke11subjobj}a, causes inhibitory interference at the main verb \textit{compromised}, while no such effect was present when the distractor \textit{the witness} was in object position as in \ref{ex:vandyke11subjobj}b.

\begin{exe} 
\ex \label{ex:vandyke11subjobj}

\item[a.] The judge who had declared that \underline{\textbf{the witness}/\textbf{the motion} was inappropriate} realized that the attorney in the case compromised.
\item[b.] The judge who \underline{had rejected \textbf{the witness}/\textbf{the motion}} realized that the attorney in the case compromised.
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}  


\cite{PatilVasishthLewis2016} found an interference effect at the reflexive in an eyetracking experiment using sentences as in \ref{ex:patil} with the distractor \textit{Fred} in subject position, which was a modification of \cite{Sturt2003} (shown in \ref{ex:sturt:exp2}) where the distractor was in object position.

In the manipulation of \cite{VanDykeMcElree2011}, a prominent distractor (in subject position) in a target-match configuration caused inhibitory interference while a non-prominent distractor (in object position) did not. 
\revFE{
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew}, our prominence model predicts that the inhibitory effect in target-match configurations increases with higher distractor prominence as long as the distractor activation is still lower than the target activation (see region between points a and b in Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}.1).
}

In a reflexive-antecedent study in Mandarin Chinese, \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2015} found a similar difference in target-match configurations between their Experiment 1, where a distractor was present in the sentence, and their Experiment 2, where three distractors were presented as memory load. An inhibitory target-match interference effect was only found in Experiment 2. 
In addition to the higher number of distractors in Experiment 2, the need to rehearse the distractors 
while reading/comprehending the target sentence
 would make them more prominent in memory, i.e., increase their activation, which would amplify the interference effect, again as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew}.



\paragraph{B: Target-match facilitation}
\cite[][Exp.\ 1]{Sturt2003} and \cite[][Exp.\ 2]{CunningsFelser2013} found \emph{facilitatory interference} in target-match configurations when the distractor was in subject position \emph{and} had been made the discourse topic using a context sentence.
Cunnings and Felser used sentences such as Example~\ref{ex:cf13:ex2} and the baseline condition shown in Example~\ref{ex:cf13:ex2baseline}, where the distractor noun phrase was introduced in a context sentence and was co-referred to in the target sentence through the pronoun \textit{he}. 
The authors hypothesized that the distractor was more prominently encoded due to reactivation at the anaphor, and that this
may have increased the probability of observing an interference effect at the reflexive (pp.\ 212-213).

A distractor \revised{that is a discourse topic and}  is also in subject position would arguably be more prominent than if it were just in subject position but not \revised{a discourse topic}. The qualitative difference of the target-match effects described above is thus predicted by our model. 
\revFE{As explained above, a distractor that is more activated than the target causes an increasing number of misretrievals of the highly-activated distractor, which has a faster retrieval latency and therefore yields a facilitatory interference effect on average when the speed-up is strong enough to counter-act the fan effect (right-hand side of point d in Fig.~\ref{fig:promEnsMatch}).}


In summary, the integration of prominence in the form of \revFE{base-level} activation \revFE{(assumption 1$'$) and the fan effect being a function of distractor activation (assumption 2$'$)} can explain \emph{inhibitory} interference effects in target-match configurations with a prominent distractor that were not found with a non-prominent distractor \citep{VanDykeMcElree2011,PatilVasishthLewis2016,JaegerEngelmannVasishth2015}, and \emph{facilitatory} interference effects in target-match configurations with a highly prominent distractor that was in subject position \emph{and} the discourse topic \citep{CunningsFelser2013,Sturt2003}.
The original LV05 model neither predicts facilitatory interference effects in target-match configurations nor the systematic absence of an effect under certain conditions.
Earlier, in Table~\ref{tab:resultsMeta1}, we indicated the explanatory gaps of LV05 with respect to the outcomes of the \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017} meta-analysis, specifically the facilitatory interference effect in target-match configurations in subject-verb agreement and the absence of an overall effect in reflexives and reciprocals. 
Taking into account item prominence as presented above, these unexplained effects are possible outcomes of low, medium or high prominence values on the continuum shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew}.

\revFE{
Next, we investigate the prediction space of LV05 under assumption 3$'$ that retrieval cues can be associated with multiple features to varying degrees.
}




\subsection{Multi-associative Cues}
\label{sec:cueconf}
\revFE{
The noun \textit{surgeon} in the sentence ``the surgeon who treated Jennifer had pricked herself'' receives increased activation in memory when retrieval is triggered at \textit{himself} because it matches the syntactic cue \actrcue{CCOM}.
The distractor \textit{Jennifer} receives the same amount of activation through its match with the gender cue \actrcue{FEM}. As depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:ACTRpred}d, this leads to the situation with two similarly activated items, but no fan effect because their features do not overlap --- each item is associated with a different cue.
This leads to statistical facilitation in the way explained earlier.

In ACT-R models, a match between a cue and a feature is binary and categorical: A feature and a cue can only match or not match, there is no gradation; and a gender cue can only be matched by gender features (\texttt{masc}, \texttt{fem}, \texttt{neut}) and is not associated at all with features of a different category.
Such categorical one-to-one relations are, of course, a simplification made for modeling, but they are not well motivated when we accept that language acquisition is essentially a gradual process of learning the mapping from form to meaning on the basis of contextual cues \citep[see, e.g.,][]{bybee2006usage,langacker1987foundations,tomasello2003constructing}. The strength and distinctiveness of representational associations are thus dependent on \emph{similarities} with other associations.
In that sense, retrieval cues represent abstract knowledge about the features that successfully identify the correct retrieval target, as derived from experience with a certain dependency context. Hence, cue-feature associations evolve as graded associations between a retrieval context and any features of the correct target resulting from a process of learning relevant discriminations between features. 
As a result, it is possible that, in certain situations, a cue can be associated with \emph{multiple} feature values to varying degrees. 

Now, there is no specific reason why, in the sentence ``the surgeon who treated Jennifer had pricked herself'', the syntactic cue would be associated with gender features or vice versa. 
But consider, for example, the sentence ``the nurse who cared for the children had pricked each other''.
The relevant retrieval cues for the reciprocal \textit{each other} are \actrcue{CCOM} and \actrcue{PLURAL}. The cue \actrcue{CCOM} is matched by the syntactically correct target \textit{the nurse} and \actrcue{PLURAL} is matched by the distractor \textit{the children}.
The difference between reciprocals, such as \textit{each other}, and reflexives, such as \textit{herself}, is that the correct target in a reciprocal context \emph{always} exhibits the features \match{plur} and \match{ccom}, while there are several possible forms in a reflexive context, e.g., \textit{himself}, \textit{herself}, \textit{itself}, and \textit{themselves}, which all trigger different combinations of the syntactic cue with gender and number cues, as listed in Table~\ref{tbl:featurecombinations}.

The \actrcue{CCOM} cue in reflexive contexts would therefore not be strongly associated with, e.g., the \match{FEM} feature because this would activate the wrong items whenever the form of the reflexive is not \textit{herself} but \textit{himself} or \textit{themselves}, etc. Therefore, the reflexive context requires syntactic, gender and number features to be discriminated.
In reciprocal contexts, however, the correct target has to be plural. In this case, if the \actrcue{CCOM} cue were to be associated with the \match{PLURAL} feature, it would always activate the correct target. 
Because \match{CCOM} and \match{PLURAL} \emph{co-occur} frequently in similar contexts for reciprocal-antecedent dependencies, a strong discrimination is less required than in reflexive contexts. Instead, it might even be more efficient to also activate plural items with the \actrcue{ccom} cue and vice versa. 
This reasoning builds on the ideas of classical conditioning \citep{RescorlaWagner1972}, where two stimuli that require similar responses in similar contexts become less discriminated than when they elicit different responses.
As a consequence, the cues \actrcue{ccom} and \actrcue{plural} in reciprocal-antecedent dependencies would be less \textbf{discriminative} than the cues in reflexive-antecedent dependencies and would therefore both be associated to some degree with both the features \match{ccom} and \match{plur}. We will say that, in this situation, two cues are \textbf{cross-associated} due to \textbf{feature co-occurrence}.
}
A similar situation arises for the Chinese reflexive \textit{ziji} (also shown in Table~\ref{tbl:featurecombinations}), which requires an animate and c-commanding target. Thus, in the case of \textit{ziji}, \actrcue{ccom} would be cross-associated with \actrcue{anim}.


\revFE{
For an illustration of the predictions that would arise from cross-associated cues, consider Figure~\ref{fig:newmodelcueconf}. The figure shows the no-interference (c) and interference (d) conditions in \emph{target-mismatch} configurations when cues are cross-associated in contrast to Figure~\ref{fig:ACTRpred}, where no cross-association was present.
}
Because the \actrcue{ccom} and \actrcue{plur} cues are cross-associated, both cues behave here as a kind of amalgamated cue that is associated with both the \match{ccom} and the \match{plur} feature. 
In the target-mismatch/distractor-mismatch condition c, the target therefore receives activation from both cues although it only carries the \match{ccom} feature.
In the target-mismatch/distractor-match condition d, the target carries \match{ccom} and the distractor carries \match{plur}. As a consequence, both cues now share their activation between target and distractor, i.e., they are overloaded. 
This leads to a similar situation as in target-match configurations shown earlier in condition b of Figure~\ref{fig:ACTRpred}: As spreading activation is shared between target and distractor, inhibitory interference, i.e., a \emph{fan effect}, arises.
% Since there is a \emph{cross-association} between cues and features, both cues are now overloaded and share the available activation between the \match{plur} and \match{ccom} features.
This is because both items are less activated in d than the target is in c and will be retrieved slower in d vs.\ c.\footnote{\revised{The reader may wonder why a facilitatory race effect does not emerge in target-mismatch when cross-associated cues induce a fan effect: after all, both the target and distractor again have similar activations. A similar activation of target and distractor is   a prerequisite for a race-based statistical facilitation. 
For a race-induced facilitation, however, the target would have to be similarly activated in both conditions c and d, as is the case without cross-association (Figure~\ref{fig:ACTRpred}). With cross-association, the target has higher activation in c, whereas in d, the activation is shared with the distractor and therefore reduced. Therefore, the target's activation in c is much higher relative to the activations in condition d of the two racing items (i.e., the target and the distractor). Hence, the target in c will be retrieved faster on average than the winner of the race in condition d, and consequently no facilitation effect will be observed in d vs.\ c.

% Translated into ACT-R terms, discriminating features at retrieval means there are distinct cues activating each feature. If features are not discriminated at all, they are activated by the same cue, i.e., they are treated as one and the same feature by the retrieval process. Depending on the specific feature co-occurrence rate, there are gradations between these two extremes. Some features might be very similar but not identical in terms of relevance to the retrieval task.
% There would then be two cues that are to a certain degree activating both of the features. We will say that, in this case, the cues are \emph{cross-associated}.
% The stronger the association between a cue and a feature, the more efficient the cue is for discriminating items with that feature in memory.\footnote{
% 	In the context of the ACT-R architecture, an associative relation between cues and features, though not implemented, is a rather straightforward assumption. In ACT-R, any two memory items can be assigned a mutual similarity. This includes feature values and cue values as these are items in memory, too. 
% 	Similarities are used, for example, in the equation for a component called \emph{mismatch penalty}, which we do not discuss here. 
% 	% It enables the model to retrieve items that do not match the retrieval cues but might nevertheless be similar (e.g., an orange item when using the retrieval cue \actrcue{red}). 
% 	We propose that the same similarity values should be included in the computation of the fan effect.
% }



The cross-association level $c$ takes values between $0$ and $1$, where $c = 0$ means that two features are maximally discriminated (distinct cues activate distinct features) and $c = 1$ means that their corresponding features are treated as functionally identical, i.e., each cue activates both features.
% In order to quantify the confusion level for a specific context, such as reciprocal-antecedent vs.\ reflexive-antecedent dependencies, one could carry out a corpus analysis counting co-occurrence frequencies.
% For an illustration of the difference in confusion levels between two dependency contexts, consider the following simplification:

More formally, $c_{kl}(Context)$ is the cross-association level $c$ with respect to features $k$ and $l$ in a particular retrieval context (e.g., English reciprocals), and is equal to the strength with which each feature is associated with the corresponding cue of the other feature. 
For example, if the cross-association level of \match{ccom} and \match{plural} in reciprocals equals $0.5$, it means that the \actrcue{ccom} cue is associated with the \match{plural} feature with strength $0.5$ and the \actrcue{plural} cue is associated with the \match{ccom} feature with strength $0.5$. 
This means that, in the absence of the plural cue, a plural item would still receive activation from the cue \actrcue{ccom}, but the plural item would not receive as much activation as a c-commanding item would.
Thus, at $c=0.5$, there is still some discrimination between the features in question. 
If, however, $c=1.0$, plural and c-command would not be discriminated at all as distinct information. Any item with one of the two features would be activated by any of the two cues in the same way. 
This effectively means that we would not think of two cues in this case but only one that is associated equally with two features.

Theoretically, the cross-association level $c$ reflects the
relative frequency of co-occurrence of both features, relative to the frequency of occurrence of either of the features.
%as target identifiers relative to their individual frequency with respect to a certain retrieval context over the course of learning.
For example, consider 
Table~\ref{tbl:featurecombinations}, which shows several co-occurring features. 
We could say that the cross-association level $c_{kl}(Context)$ is the ratio of all feature combinations with both $k$ and $l$ with respect to all combinations with at least $k$ or $l$, given a particular context:
  % as the relation between the number of possible combinations in a retrieval context $x$, where the correct target possesses both features $k$ and $l$ simultaneously and the number of all possible combinations in context $x$ where at least one of the features is present:
% (\ref{eq:cmetric}).
% $C = N(k_1 \land k_2)/N(k_1 \lor k_2)$.
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:cmetric}
	c_{kl}(Context) = \frac{\sum{[k \land l | Context]}}{\sum{[k \lor l | Context]}} 
	% C_x(k,l) = \frac{\sum_i{[k \in \textit{Comb}(x)_i \land l \in \textit{Comb}(x)_i]}}{\sum_i{[k \in \textit{Comb}(x)_i \lor l \in \textit{Comb}(x)_i]}},
\end{equation}
% 
where 
% $\textit{Comb}(x)_i$ denotes feature combination $i$ of all possible feature combinations $\textit{Comb}(x)$ for the correct target of dependency context $x$, and 
the square brackets represent an Iverson bracket which denotes $1$ if the enclosed condition is satisfied and $0$ if not.
% 
This way, we can say, e.g., that the cross-association levels for the examples in Table~\ref{tbl:featurecombinations} are for reflexives $c_{\actrcue{ccom},\actrcue{masc}}(\textit{refl-EN}) = 1/4 = 0.25$, for reciprocals $c_{\actrcue{ccom},\actrcue{plur}}(\textit{reci-EN}) = 1/1 = 1.0$, and for \textit{ziji} $c_{\actrcue{ccom},\actrcue{plur}}(\textit{ziji}) = 1/1 = 1.0$.
 % between \actrcue{ccom} and \actrcue{plur} in reciprocals is $c_{\textit{reci}}(\actrcue{ccom}, \actrcue{plur}) = 1/1 = 1.0$ compared to a level of $c_{\textit{refl}}(\actrcue{ccom}, \actrcue{masc}) = 1/4 = 0.25$ between \actrcue{ccom} and \actrcue{masc} in English reflexives. This, of course, delivers a simplified picture which merely provides an estimate of the relative difference between two dependency contexts. %rather than an absolute quantification.
The absolute values of these parameters are not of importance here; this example only serves as an illustration of the difference between English reflexives on the one hand and English reciprocals or \textit{ziji} on the other.
What this calculation suggests is that, when processing English reflexives, more distinct cue representations are used due to a greater variety of feature combinations than for reciprocals or \textit{ziji}.


% \subsection{Predictions arising from multi-associative cues}

% As was shown above in Figure~\ref{fig:ACTRpred}, inhibitory interference in ACT-R only arises in configurations with \emph{cue-overload} such as the target-match examples in \ref{ex:sturt03:exp2}b vs.\ \ref{ex:sturt03:exp2}a.
% Since in target-mismatch configurations, such as \ref{ex:sturt03:exp2}c and d, none of the manipulated features are shared between the competitors, no fan effect arises. 


In summary, the theory of multi-associative cues predicts that a cue could in some situations share its spreading activation between what would otherwise be categorically distinct features. In these situations, a fan effect can arise even in \emph{target-mismatch} configurations. 
% and not only in target-match configurations as in standard ACT-R.
\revFE{
Table~\ref{tab:resultsMeta1} shows inhibitory instead of facilitatory interference in target-mismatch configurations. This has been found, for instance, in some studies on reflexives and reciprocals and can be explained neither by LV05 nor by item prominence. 
According to ACT-R, inhibitory interference simply cannot arise in target-mismatch configurations because the necessary condition for a fan effect --- an overloaded cue due to multiple matches --- is not met.
}
\revFE{Our approach of using multi-associative cues} predicts a higher cross-association level for both reciprocals and the Chinese reflexive \textit{ziji} compared to English reflexives. This could explain the result of \cite{KushPhillips2014}, who found inhibitory interference in target-mismatch conditions in Hindi reciprocals,\footnote{As discussed in \cite{KushPhillips2014}, Hindi reciprocals have properties identical to English reciprocals: the antecedent must c-command the reciprocal and also match the reciprocal in morphological features (plural), and the antecedent must be in the same clause as the reciprocal.} 
as well as our finding of an inhibitory target-mismatch effect for Chinese \textit{ziji} in Experiment 1 of \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2015}.

The following section explains the implementation of both multi-associative cues and item prominence in our extended ACT-R model.

\subsection{Implementation of item prominence and multi-associative cues}
\label{sec:impl}

The ACT-R architecture already has the basic theoretical constructs needed for implementing prominence and multi-associative cues.
For example, in ACT-R, any two memory items can be assigned a numerical value that signifies how similar they are to each other. Thus, the colors orange and red can be treated as more similar to each other than orange and green. Because feature values  are also treated as items in memory, similarities can be assigned to pairs of features as well.
In ACT-R, similarities are used, for example, in the equation for a component called \emph{mismatch penalty} that enables the model to retrieve items that do not match the retrieval cues but might nevertheless be similar. Thus, an orange item can be retrieved even though the retrieval cue specifies a red one.
We extend the ACT-R framework such that the similarity between features is also used in the computation of the fan effect. 

\revVI{The general idea of our extension is that each item's prominence as well as specific cue-feature associations are reflected in the associative strength $S_{ji}$ between a cue $j$ and an item $i$, which in turn affects the activation $A_i$ of that item.
In other words, the associative strength that a memory item has with a specific cue reflects the prominence status of \emph{all memory items} and the relative associations of that cue with \emph{all features of all memory items}.
Therefore, the two mechanisms item prominence and multi-associative cues are merely two aspects of one broader mechanism, namely the association of the available retrieval cues with specific memory items.
In order to incorporate prominence and multi-associative cues, we redefine the associative strength $S_{ji}$.
}
Recall from Equation~\ref{eq:act} that, given a set of retrieval cues ($\textit{Cues} = \{q1,\dots,qJ\}$), the activation $A_i$ of an item $i$ is a function of spreading activation $S_i$:

\begin{equation}
A_i \propto S_i \hbox{ where } S_i = \sum\limits_{j \in \textit{Cues}} W_j S_{ji}
\end{equation}

  
For each cue $j$, the standard ACT-R calculation of $S_{ji}$ is based on its fan, which is defined as the number of items that match this cue. 
Instead of this simplified definition, we base our implementation on the more general definition of $S_{ji}$ \citep[p.\ 129]{SchneiderAnderson2012}. This general definition states that the association between cue $j$ and item $i$ reflects the probability of the item being needed (i.e., is the target of the retrieval) given cue $j$:\footnote{We thank Klaus Oberauer for his helpful comments, which led to the present implementation.}
\begin{equation}
	S_{ji} = \hbox{MAS} + \hbox{ln}[P(i|j)]
\end{equation}

The standard equation that calculates the fan as the number of matching items which is usually used in ACT-R implementations makes the simplifying assumption that all items associated with cue $j$ are equally likely (i.e., \textit{useful} in the context of cue $j$), such that $P(i|j) = 1/\textit{fan}_j$. It is important to note here that the probability $P(i|j)$ for item $i$ is only defined when it is associated with cue $j$.

%Hence, for two items that are equally useful, $P(i|j) = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5$ and the associative strength $S_{ji}$ can be simplified as $\textit{MAS} + \text{ln}(1/\textit{fan}_j)$, which is equivalent to $\textit{MAS} - \text{ln}(\textit{fan}_j)$.
%; this is how the standard equation (\ref{eq:assoc2}) arises.
% 
% \begin{equation}
% 	S_{ji} = S - \text{ln}(\textit{fan}_j)
% \end{equation}
% 

In order to reflect differences in encoding strength between items (\emph{prominence}) and cross-associations between cues, we define $P(i|j)$ here as the \textbf{match quality} $Q_{ji}$ (which will be defined further below) of item $i$ with cue $j$ in proportion to the match quality $Q_{jv}$ of all active memory items $v$ with $j$:
% 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:newfan}
	P(i|j) = \frac{Q_{ji}}{\sum\limits_{v \in Items} Q_{jv}}
\end{equation}
%
The next two subsections will explain how this leads to multi-associative cues and the influence of item prominence on the fan effect.


\subsection{Multi-associative cues}
We assume that a cue can habe variable discrimination, i.e., it can be associated with multiple features to different degrees. The associative strength between a cue $j$ and a feature $k$ is given by $M_{jk}$, which takes values between $0$ (not associated) and $1$ (maximally associated). 
% In standard ACT-R, $M_{jk}$ could take only $0$ (`not matching') or $1$ (`matching') as values. In our proposal, $M_{jk}$ can take any value from $0$ to $1$.
The individual match quality $Q_{ji}$ of cue $j$ with a specific item $i$ then depends on the associative strength between $j$ and all features $K_i$ of $i$. 
% , weighted by the \emph{general saliency} of the item.
% The saliency is discussed below; for now, we only focus on the first term ($\sum_{k \in K_i} M_{jk}$):

\begin{equation}
    Q_{ji} = \sum_{k \in K_i} M_{jk} \label{eq:Qji}
\end{equation}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:cueconf}, cross-association predicts a fan effect also for items that do not share any of their features, as long as the same cue is associated with features from both items. We work through some examples next.

For the worked-out examples below, assume that an item $i$ has feature f$1$ but not feature f$2$, and a distractor item $i'$ has feature f$2$ but not f$1$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:implFig1}). Assume also that the retrieval cue q$1$ matches f$1$, and cue q$2$ matches f$2$. Retrieval is triggered using the two cues q$1$ and q$2$. This is the typical target-mismatch/distractor-match scenario discussed earlier.


\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figures/implFig1}
	\caption{Standard target-mismatch/distractor-match condition without cross-associated cues.}
	\label{fig:implFig1}
\end{figure}


% \begin{verbatim}
% Figure xxx

%                              f2 ------------------ c2
% \end{verbatim}


\begin{enumerate}
\item
\textbf{No cross-association of features (standard ACT-R case)}:
In the case that there is no cross-association, the spreading activation to item $i$ from cue q$1$ depends on the probability of item $i$ given cue q$1$:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:newfannoxassoc2}
	P(i|q1) = \frac{Q_{q1,i}}{\sum\limits_{v\in Items} Q_{q1,v}}
\end{equation}

The numerator is computed as follows. Since only feature f$1$ matches cue q$1$ in item $i$, we have:

\begin{equation}
Q_{q1,i} = \sum_{k \in K_i} M_{q1,k} = M_{q1,f1} = 1
\end{equation}

The denominator, $\sum\limits_{v \in Items} Q_{q1,v}$, also has value $1$ because it is the sum of the match of cue q$1$ to item $i$ (which is 1) and to item $i'$ (which is 0):

\begin{equation}
\sum_{v\in Items} Q_{q1,v} = Q_{q1,i} + Q_{q1,i'} = 1 + 0 
\end{equation}

The  calculation of $P(i|j)$ is therefore:

\begin{equation}
P(i|j) =  P(i|q1) = \frac{Q_{q1,i}}{\sum\limits_{v \in Items} Q_{q1,v}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 
\end{equation}

This implies that the spreading activation from cue q$1$ to item $i$ is:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split} 
	S_{q1,i} =& \textit{MAS} + \text{ln}[P(i|q1)] \\
	         =& \textit{MAS} + \text{ln}[1] = \textit{MAS}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

As no other cue matches item $i$, $S_{q1,i}$ equals the total amount of spreading activation $S_i$ that item $i$ receives: 

\begin{equation}
	S_{i} = S_{q1,i} = \textit{MAS} 
\end{equation}

Thus, there is no penalty to the activation of item $i$ caused by spreading activation (fan effect) in target-mismatch/distractor-match configurations when there is no cross-association. 

\item \textbf{Cross-association of 0.5}:
Now consider the activation spread to item $i$ when the cross-association level of the cues is $0.5$. Under this scenario, item $i$ receives not only 100\%  activation from the fully matching cue q$1$, but also from q$2$ which spreads $50\%$ of its activation to feature f$1$. The distractor $i'$ similarly gets activation not only from  q$2$, which fully matches  f$2$, but also from  q$1$ which spreads $50\%$ of its activation to feature f$2$.   Graphically, this corresponds to the following scenario (Figure~\ref{fig:implFig2}):

\begin{figure}[htbp]

	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{figures/implFig2}

	P(i|q1) = \frac{Q_{q1,i}}{\sum\limits_{v\in Items} Q_{q1,v}} = \frac{1}{1.5} = \frac{2}{3}
\end{equation}

This is because $Q_{q1,i} = 1$  as before, but the denominator is the sum of the match of cue q$1$ to item $i$ (a match of 1) as well as the match of cue q$1$ to item $i'$ (a match of 0.5).

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{v\in Items} Q_{q1,v} = Q_{q1,i} + Q_{q1,i'} = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5
\end{equation}

We then use $P(i|q1)$ to calculate the spreading activation $S_{q1,i}$ from cue q$1$ to item $i$. In contrast to the scenario above without cross association, the amount of activation spread $S_{q1,i}$ is now smaller than \textit{MAS}:

\begin{equation}
S_{q1,i} = \textit{MAS} + \text{ln}\left[\frac{2}{3}\right] =  \textit{MAS} + [\Sexpr{round(log(1/1.5),2)}] = \textit{MAS} - \Sexpr{-1*round(log(1/1.5),2)}
\end{equation}

Next, the calculation for item $i$ and cue q$2$ is:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:newfannoxassoc4}
	P(i|q2) = \frac{Q_{q2,i}}{\sum\limits_{v\in Items} Q_{q2,v}} = \frac{0.5}{1.5} = \frac{1}{3}
\end{equation}

Here, $Q_{q2,i} = 0.5$ because of the cross-association of $0.5$ of  cue q$2$ with the feature f$1$. The denominator is the sum of the match of cue q$2$ to item $i$ (a match of 0.5) as well as the match of cue q$2$ to item $i'$ (a match of 1).

\begin{equation}
\sum\limits_{v\in Items} Q_{q2,v} = Q_{q2,i} + Q_{q2,i'} = 0.5 + 1 = 1.5
\end{equation}

We now use $P(i|q2)$ to calculate the spreading activation  $S_{q2,i}$ that item $i$ receives from cue $q2$. Similar to  $S_{q1,i}$, $S_{q2,i}$ will also be smaller than \textit{MAS}: 


\begin{equation}
S_{q2,i} = \textit{MAS} + \text{ln}\left[\frac{1}{3} \right] = \textit{MAS} + [\Sexpr{round(log(0.5/1.5),2)}] = \textit{MAS} - \Sexpr{-1*round(log(0.5/1.5),2)} 
\end{equation}

Having computed $S_{q1,i}$ and $S_{q2,i}$, the total amount of spreading activation $S_i$ that item $i$ receives can be calculated ($W_j$ is $0.5$ as we have two equally weighted cues):

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
      S_i =& \sum\limits_{j\in Cues} W_{j} S_{ji} \\
          =& \frac{1}{2} S_{q1,i} + \frac{1}{2} S_{q2,i}\\
          =& \frac{1}{2}\left(\textit{MAS} + \text{ln}\left[\frac{2}{3}\right]\right) + \frac{1}{2}\left(\textit{MAS} + \text{ln}\left[\frac{1}{3}\right]\right)\\
          =& \textit{MAS} +  \frac{1}{2}\left(\text{ln}\left[\frac{2}{3}\right] + \text{ln}\left[\frac{1}{3}\right]\right) \\
          =& \textit{MAS} - \Sexpr{-1*round(.5*(log(1/1.5)+log(0.5/1.5)),2)}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\label{crossasspageref}
Because the  spreading activation $S_i$ received by item $i$ will have a value less than MAS, activation of item $i$ will go down due to the presence of the matching distractor, leading to inhibitory interference even in a target-mismatch configuration, when the cross-association level is sufficiently high.\footnote{The actual level that leads to detectable inhibitory interference depends on the specific situation being simulated and the values of other ACT-R parameters.}

\end{enumerate}

% Figure~\ref{fig:cueconf} illustrates the effect of an increasing cue confusion level. In target-mismatch configurations, a higher cue confusion causes an inhibitory fan effect that eliminates the facilitatory effect.

\subsection{Prominence}
We assume that the prominence of an item is reflected in its base-level activation, which also reflects how recently the item has been retrieved or created.
For this purpose, we simply introduce a prominence component $p_i$ as a constant added to the base-level activation $B_i$, such that Equation~\ref{eq:bl} for $B_i$ is changed to:

\begin{equation}
  B_i = \text{ln}(\sum_{j=1}^n t_j^{-d}) + \beta_i + p_i \label{eq:bl2}
\end{equation}

Thus, more prominent items are more highly activated and are therefore more likely to be retrieved.
In addition, the base-level activation including prominence should affect how strongly an item interferes with the retrieval of other items: A highly activated and thus very salient item will have a stronger fan effect than an item that is less active in memory.
We therefore introduce a \emph{saliency component} as a weighting of the individual match quality $Q_{ji}$, changing Equation~\ref{eq:Qji} in the following way:

\begin{equation}
    Q_{ji} = \sum_{k \in K_i} M_{jk} \times \frac{1}{1+qe^{-(B_i-\tau)}} \label{eq:Qji2}
\end{equation}

The saliency component (the second factor) is a logistic function that bounds the base-level activation value between $0$ and $1$, such that it functions as a scaling factor for $Q_{ji}$.
In the denominator, $\tau$ is the retrieval threshold, and $q$ is a scaling constant that  scales how strongly the match quality $Q_{ji}$ is affected by an item's saliency. It can be used to switch the quality correction on and off and thus make our model identical to standard ACT-R: When $q = 0$, the item's base-level activation including prominence is not reflected in $P(i|j)$. Furthermore, when $q = 0$ and all cues are \emph{maximally discriminative} (i.e., exactly one feature matches one cue), $P(i|j) = 1/\textit{fan}_j$, in which case the model behavior is identical to standard ACT-R.
% which is the simplified equation standardly used in ACT-R.
If, however, $q>0$, the base-level activation of an item---and with it the item's prominence---affects the associative strength between the retrieval cues and the item. 

Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew} shown earlier illustrates the relationship between distractor prominence and the interference effect as predicted by the extended model, assuming that target prominence is a \revised{fixed} value. 
 In addition to the facilitatory effect of highly activated distractors in target-match predicted also by standard ACT-R, 
the extended model additionally predicts that the fan effect only arises for sufficiently activated distractors (cf.\ the rising inhibition in target-match configurations in the figure). 
% This could explain the right-shift of the inhibitory interference effect in target-match configurations of non-agreement subject-verb dependencies due to a retroactive distractor (cf.\ Table~\ref{tab:resultsMeta2}) in addition to the stimuli-dependent explanation given in the previous section.

In sum, we define the probability of a memory item $i$ being needed given cue $j$, $P(i|j)$, with respect to the item's base-level activation, which in turn depends on its prominence, and its association with cue $j$, $M_{ji}$. The equations ensure that cues can be of variable discrimination (i.e., can be associated with one or more features), and that more  prominent items are more strongly associated with the cues and, hence, receive more spreading activation. Since $P(i|j)$ is a probability that takes into account all memory items, both the discrimination of cues and the prominence of the item itself and of all of its competitors affect the fan effect, i.e., the strength of inhibitory interference. 
The equations for the total spreading activation for item $i$ (Eq.~\ref{eq:spread}) and the retrieval latency (Eq.~\ref{eq:rt}) remain the same as in the original implementation.


% For the simulations that we present below, we assume that factors such as syntactic position (being a subject or not) and \revised{discourse topic (being a topic or not)} increase the prominence and hence the base-level activation of a distractor. As the base-level activation also  reflects an item's recency, the effect of interference type is predicted to add to the effect of prominence: A retroactively interfering distractor that is the discourse topic and is in subject position has the highest activation.
% Our account of item prominence predicts that distractor activation due to prominence and recency systematically increases the interference effect in target-match and target-mismatch configurations and can give rise to previously unexplained facilitation effects in target-match configurations for highly activated distractors.

\label{sec:sims}
\revFE{ 
In this section, we compare the specific predictions of LV05 and an extended model with item prominence and multi-associative cues for the experiments in the \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017} meta-analysis.
We make the following assumptions with regard to the relation between a specific experiment and the extended model settings for prominence and cue-feature associations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Being a sentential subject and being mentioned in a context sentence (discourse topic) both increase the prominence --- and hence the base-level activation --- of a target or distractor compared to being an object and not the discourse topic. The combination of both (subject and topic) has the highest prominence status.
	\item The cue-feature cross-association level is raised only for dependency contexts where the cues can be assumed to have low discrimination due to feature-co-occurrence. These contexts are experiments involving reciprocals and those involving the Chinese reflexive \textit{ziji}. 
\end{itemize}

The simulations presented here can be reproduced using the accompanying web application at \url{https://engelmann.shinyapps.io/inter-act/}.
The model code is available on GitHub at \url{https://github.com/felixengelmann/inter-act}.
}

% In order to demonstrate how item prominence and multi-associative cues change the model predictions when accounting for distractor position and different co-occurrence patterns between dependency types, we ran simulations with both the original LV05 model and the extended model with item prominence and multi-associative cues (LV05+IP+MAC) as described above. 
% We additionally included one recent study by \cite{CunningsSturt2017}, since this is the only study to our knowledge that tested target-mismatch configurations in non-agreement subject-verb dependencies.


\subsection{Data}
We included all studies that were part of the meta-analysis in \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017}. 
\revisedII{Table~\ref{tab:exps} in the Appendix lists all included studies with their dependency types and distractor prominence levels.
Figure~\ref{fig:datasummary} shows the number of target-match and target-mismatch comparisons for each dependency type and prominence category.
% The data contain only studies that were part of the meta-analysis in \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017}. 
At the time of the meta-analysis, no data were available for target-mismatch configurations in non-agreement subject-verb dependencies.}
A recent study by \cite{CunningsSturt2018} fills this gap but was not included in the simulations. We, however, discuss this study in the General Discussion.
We categorised the experiments into three different prominence relations for the distractor: \textit{subject position}, \revised{\textit{discourse topic}}, and \textit{other}. Subject position and \revised{discouse topic} are considered high prominence levels, while we do not make any a priori assumptions about which of \revised{the two} is more prominent than the other. The third category, \textit{other}, stands for all relations considered low prominence, which mainly consisted of the distractor being in object position or in a prepositional phrase. 
As a fourth category, the figure shows the studies where the distractor was both in subject position and \revised{a discourse topic}. We expect the prominence in this case --- and thus the distractor activation --- \revised{to be} particularly high.
As the figure shows, distractors \revised{that are a discourse topic}, and the combination of \revised{discourse topic} and subject position have so far only been tested in reflexives.

% All three prominence relations were available only in reflexive-antecedent studies. For the other dependency types, only the levels \textit{other} and \textit{subject OR topic} were available.

\subsection{Method}

The extended model as described above was implemented in \R{} \citep{R2016}. Prominence and multi-associative cues could be switched off such that the model behavior is then equivalent to LV05.
The model was set up as described on page~\pageref{sec:generalmethods} in order to simulate the four conditions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ACTRpred}, representing retrieval processes in sentences similar to Example~\ref{ex:sturt03:exp2}. 
Different from the simulations above, multiple distractors were specified for some of the studies that were part of the present simulation. 

The model was run for 5000 iterations on each experiment and yielded the mean effect sizes for target-match and target-mismatch configurations, which in each case were determined by subtracting the retrieval latency in the distractor-mismatch condition from that of the distractor-match condition.


\paragraph{Parameter estimation}
In order to ensure common parameter settings within experiments, the $77$ data points used in the meta-analysis were modeled in $51$ \emph{experimental sets}, such that parameters were held constant between target-match and target-mismatch conditions of the same experiment.
\revisedII{
Certain parameters were estimated by running the model iteratively while changing the parameter value within a pre-specified range (details are discussed below). 
The best value was determined by finding the lowest mean-squared error between the simulated and experimental effects using grid search.

As is common practice in ACT-R modeling, we estimated the latency factor $F \in \{0.1, 0.125, ..., 0.25\}$ (see Equation~\ref{eq:rt}) for each experiment in both models to scale the numerical results into a range that is comparable with the data.
In the extended model, the distractor prominence parameter $p_{dstr}$ was estimated across experiments for each of three prominence categories within dependency types: \emph{low} (neither subject nor topic), \emph{medium} (subject \emph{or} topic), and \emph{high} (subject \emph{and} topic).
% The range of possible values for $p_{dstr}$ was shifted  as follows.
For each of these categories, $p_{dstr}$ was restricted to a certain range that was determined according to the pattern in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew} as follows:
Medium prominence was constrained to be close to the target prominence ($p_{trgt} = 0$) in the area where the distractor has an influence on the fan effect of the target ($p_{dstr} \in \{-1, -0.9, ..., 2\}$); low prominence was constrained to be smaller than the target prominence ($\{-2.5, -2.4, ..., 0\}$); and high prominence was bound to values higher than the target prominence and above the point where in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew} the target-match fan effect begins to disappear ($\{1, 1.1, ..., 4\}$).

Thus, the full range of predictions shown in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew} can be generated theoretically, but the generating process is restricted to specific properties of the distractor. 
Without restricting the prominence parameter in this way, the model cannot be fit in a meaningful way because some predictions can result from multiple prominence values. This can be see in Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew} (e.g., the absence of a target-match effect is predicted at very low, very high and at a medium prominence just over $1$).
The value ranges were allowed to overlap, however, in order not to pre-impose any assumptions about specific effect sizes on the model.
The target, which was a subject in all experiments, was assumed to have equal prominence across experiments. Its prominence value was therefore set to $0$.
}

The cross-association level $c$ was estimated only for the two cases we have motivated above: reciprocals and the Chinese reflexive \emph{ziji}. It was estimated in these cases within $\{0.1, 0.2, ..., 1\}$ and set to $0$ otherwise.

Interference type (retro vs.\ proactive interference) was reflected in the model by manipulating the order of target and distractor. For retroactive interference designs, the target was more distant from the retrieval site than the distractor, and vice versa for proactive interference designs. Hence, interference type affects the model through the memory decay component, which reduces the activation of an item as a function of time.

\subsection{Results}
\revIV{We ran simulations both with the original LV05 model and with the extended model that included item prominence and multi-associative cues (LV05+IP+MAC).}
Because \cite{LewisVasishth2005} speculated that model fit might improve without the decay component of ACT-R,\footnote{
    \cite{LewisVasishth2005} write on p.\ 408: ``Any structural or quantitative change to the model that moves in the direction of decreased emphasis on decay and increased emphasis on interference would likely yield better fits.''}
we also ran variants of both models without the decay component.
% Interference effects were computed within target-match and target-mismatch conditions as the difference between distractor-match (high interference) and distractor-mismatch (low interference) conditions, averaged over $5000$ iterations per simulation.

Table~\ref{tab:simfit} summarizes the fit for all four model configurations in terms of the \revFE{root-mean-square deviation}, averaged within dependency types.
Overall, the extended model with IP and MAC fit the available data better than the original model of LV05. 
Except for non-agreement subject-verb dependencies, the use of decay did not improve the fit with the data. 
With respect to the extended model, decay only improved the fit for non-agreement subject-verb dependencies but, for the other dependency types, produced a worse fit compared to the model without decay. 
Since decay generally does not improve the fit, this suggests that the information about the linear order of target and distractor (pro- vs.\ retroactive interference) may not be useful as a predictor in the models and data considered here. 
We revisit this point in the General Discussion.

More important than the numerical fit of a computational model with the data, however, is that the model correctly reproduces observed patterns in a principled way. As we saw in Table~\ref{tab:resultsMeta1} earlier, certain observed patterns were incompatible with LV05, specifically, facilitatory interference in subject-verb agreement target-match configurations, inhibitory interference in reflexive/reciprocal target-mismatch, and the absence of an effect in reflexive/reciprocal target-match.
The content of Table~\ref{tab:resultsMeta1} is repeated here graphically in Figure~\ref{fig:simresultsBayesMeans}. The figure shows the estimates for the mean effect  along with 95\% credible intervals, as well as the average simulated effects of both models for the same three dependency categories as in Table~\ref{tab:resultsMeta1}.
A qualitative improvement can be seen in reflexive/reciprocal dependencies. The extended model's results are within the 95\% credible intervals of the data estimates, showing that LV05+IP+MAC can potentially explain why no effect was found in target-match and inhibition was found in target-mismatch.
In terms of the facilitatory effect in subject-verb agreement target-match configurations, the extended model does not show a qualitative difference to LV05 but merely shows a smaller effect that is closer to the mean estimated from the data.

The crucial difference between the two models is that
\revFE{
the LV05 cannot explain the data that show facilitation in target-match or inhibition in target-mismatch configurations. The extended model, however, can account for these patterns when they can be explained by distractor prominence and cross-associated cues.}
% Therefore, while the means of the effects predicted by LV05 seen in Figure~\ref{fig:simresultsBayesMeans} do not vary much between individual experiments, the means predicted by LV05+IP+MAC are the result of principled variation between individual experiments. We explain this point next.

\revFE{
This becomes more apparent when presenting the means by distractor prominence levels as in Figure~\ref{fig:simresults}.
}
% \revisedII{Figure~\ref{fig:simresults} shows the predicted means by distractor prominence levels.
Here, the simulated means are compared to the \textit{sample means} estimated from the \textit{individual} studies' data, which are classified by dependency type and prominence category (see Table~\ref{tab:exps}). Such a display of the studies' sample means is very different from the estimates from the meta-analysis of \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017}, which summarize what we have learnt from the collection of studies on each dependency type.
The reason that we are not using the estimates in this figure is that, due to the sparsity of the data, these were not available by prominence level and dependency type in the meta-analysis.

% Compare Figure~\ref{fig:simresults} with Figure~\ref{fig:simresultsBayesMeans}. 
Although the extended model does not show a facilitatory effect in \emph{subject-verb agreement} target-match configurations on average (collapsing over all prominence levels in Figure~\ref{fig:simresultsBayesMeans}), Figure~\ref{fig:simresults} shows that it produces the correct result for those studies that are categorized as having higher distractor prominence.
This result of facilitatory interference arises because the prominence parameter $p_{dstr}$ in the LV05+IP+MAC model was estimated to be higher on average for medium prominence experiments compared to low prominence experiments, as summarized in Table~\ref{tab:promtab}. 

For \emph{non-agreement subject-verb dependencies}, the fit did not improve in the LV05+IP+MAC model, because the data only contain target-match configurations, for which the results --- mainly inhibitory interference --- are perfectly compatible with LV05. There are also no differences between prominence categories in the data. Consequently, the prominence parameter was not estimated to be different between low and medium prominent distractors.

% \paragraph{Reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent dependencies}
The most interesting results are observed in \emph{reflexive and reciprocal dependencies}.
Looking at the means separately for each prominence category shows that the extended model offers an explanation for why the target-match and target-mismatch effects on average seem to deviate from the predictions of LV05.
As can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:simresults}, the average effects in reflexive/reciprocal target-match configurations show increasing inhibition from low to medium prominence and facilitatory interference in high prominence. This is exactly the pattern that our prominence model predicts (see Figure~\ref{fig:prominenceNew} shown earlier). Consequently, the extended model matches this pattern while LV05 does not.
LV05+IP+MAC produces a mixture of inhibitory and facilitatory effects in target-match as a consequence of distractor prominence, which would explain why no effect could be found in the data on average.
In target-mismatch configurations, the data shows inhibitory effects on average in all three prominence categories. This is incompatible with LV05. 
However, with multi-associative cues, LV05+IP+MAC produces means with a positive sign for low and medium distractor prominence of reflexives and reciprocals. These are driven by the model fitting the inhibitory target-mismatch effects of \cite{KushPhillips2014} and \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2015} with an increased estimate of the cross-association parameter for both studies. 
Thus, the explanation for the inhibitory effect seen on average in reflexive/reciprocal target-mismatch effects in the data would be that some of the studies on reflexive/reciprocal dependencies contained in the meta-analysis qualify for high cue-feature cross-association levels.

Finally, for a better understanding of what drives the differences between the two models, we show four exemplary cases in Figure~\ref{fig:simresultsSlct}, where the data \emph{qualitatively} deviates from the predictions of the original LV05 model. 
The studies by \cite{KushPhillips2014} on reciprocals and by \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2015} on Chinese reflexives are two cases of low feature discrimination as explained in the section on multi-associative cues. As a result of the cue-feature cross-association, LV05+IP+MAC shows \emph{inhibitory} interference effects in target-mismatch configurations, whereas LV05 shows facilitation. 
The model parameter for the cross-association level was estimated at 0.7 for both reciprocals \citep{KushPhillips2014} and 
%at tabconf$CueConf[1]+1 for 
\textit{ziji} \citep{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2015}.
\cite{CunningsFelser2013} and \cite{Sturt2003} are examples of \emph{facilitatory} effects in target-match configurations, which only the extended model accounts for as a consequence of high distractor prominence values.

However, \cite{CunningsFelser2013} is also an example of a pattern that is not compatible with \revised{either} of the two tested models. The inhibitory target-mismatch effect is not fit by LV05+IP+MAC because no increased cross-association is assumed in English reflexives. And even if the cross-association level was assumed to be elevated in this case, it would be impossible to simulate an inhibitory target-mismatch effect and a facilitatory target-match effect at the same time. 
Hence, under the assumptions of the two cue-based retrieval models tested here, the data of \cite{CunningsFelser2013} are not compatible with any model. We return to this point in the General Discussion.


\section{General Discussion}
The aims of this work were to investigate the quantitative predictions of the \cite{LewisVasishth2005} model and to investigate the consequences of memory accessibility and context-dependent cue-feature associations in the light of the available evidence from reading studies on interference effects in dependency resolution.
We have presented an implemented model of prominence and multi-associative cues as an extension to the cue-based retrieval model of LV05. 
\revFE{
The extension consisted of three revisions of previously simplifying assumptions of ACT-R/LV05 modeling:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[1$'$.] The base-level activation of items in memory (i.e., accessibility) is affected by --- in addition to recency --- their prominence in the current context, i.e., their  relevance/salience in terms of syntactic relations in a sentence or information-structural and discourse properties.
  \item[2$'$.] The strength of any interference effect, i.e., also the fan effect, is not simply \revV{determined by} the presence vs.\ absence of a distractor but also changes as a function of the distractor's activation in memory relative to the target.
  \item[3$'$.] The associative strength between a retrieval cue and a memory item can be the result of multiple cues being associated with multiple features at variable degrees. Cue-feature associations are based on associative learning through language experience. 
\end{enumerate}
}


% 
Our simulations show that prominence and multi-associative cues can account for a range of data points that were not predicted by the original model. 
\revFE{
In particular, while the prediction space of LV05 allows only two qualitatively different outcomes (inhibition in target-match and facilitation in target-mismatch configurations), the prediction space of the extended model allows, under certain specific circumstances, all four qualitative outcomes seen in the data (inhibition and facilitation in both target-match and target-mismatch configurations). 
This shows that well motivated assumptions are of crucial importance when specifying a model, as slight alterations can have consequences not only quantitatively but also qualitatively.
In the current case, accounting for individual study design and integrating independently motivated assumptions about memory accessibility and context-based feature discrimination considerably changed the model's prediction space.
}
We therefore believe that these independently motivated extensions help to more precisely interpret individual empirical results as being evidence in favor of or against the model. 
% The simulations presented here thus complement the meta-analysis in \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017} in the aim to uncover the cognitive mechanisms behind interference effects.
The simulations presented here thus provide new insights into the cognitive mechanisms behind interference effects.
% Specifically, the model predictions are restricted by independently motivated assumptions about memory retrieval and 

\revFE{
It is important to note that the model does not predict just any possible outcome; if that were the case, the model would not be very meaningful or useful \citep{rp}.
First of all, the predictions of prominence and cross-associated cues are restricted to very specific circumstances regarding the grammatical and discourse role of the distractor in the individual experiment and the type of dependency used (e.g., reflexive or reciprocal).
The second constraint is that, while some parameters were estimated for best fit with the data in the simulations, parameters were fixed across all conditions of an individual experiment.
}
This restricts the predictions of the model considerably; for example, the model cannot predict, for the same experiment, an \emph{inhibitory} effect in target-mismatch as well as a \emph{facilitatory} effect in target-match configurations, which was found in gaze durations of readers with low working memory capacity in Exp.~2 of \cite{CunningsFelser2013} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simresultsSlct}. 
This is because a facilitatory target-match effect is caused by a high distractor activation that overrides the fan effect. Consequently, the fan effect must be eliminated in both the target-match \textit{and} target-mismatch configurations in the presence of a highly prominent distractor even if we assumed a high cross-association level.
Hence, the model makes the strong prediction that the pattern observed by \cite{CunningsFelser2013} should \emph{not} occur. An important line of future work would be to attempt to replicate the Cunnings and Felser result; the model predicts that it should not replicate. If the model simulations had involved separate parameter fits for target-match and mismatch within the same experiment, the model would have been able to predict this and other patterns that are implausible under the model's cognitive assumptions.
% This demonstrates that the model makes restricted predictions; it is not the case that it can predict any outcome. 
%If any outcome were possible, the model would not be very useful. 
\revFE{Thus, our simulation methodology  considerably restricts the model's prediction space and are based on independently motivated assumptions.}


\revFE{The model comparisons also suggest} that decay could play a smaller role than generally assumed. Indeed, independent work in psychology argues that interference rather than decay is the more important construct  \citep{OberauerLewandowsky2014,OberauerLewandowsky2013,berman2009search}. 
However, we cannot conclusively say whether decay has no impact or is only disguised by a counteracting effect of prominence. This is because interference type (pro- vs.\ retroactive interference) and distractor prominence are confounded in the literature:
Studies with prominent distractors more often used a proactive rather than a retroactive interference design, whereas studies with non-prominent distractors more often used a retroactive interference design (see Table~\ref{tab:exps} in the Appendix).
Hence, the two factors prominence and interference type, which both influence the distractor activation in memory, might tend to cancel each other out in particular experimental designs. 
The role of decay could be investigated in future work by designing an experiment that crosses pro- and retroactive distractor position with the prominence of the distractor.


\revisedII{Some caution is also needed as regards the interpretation of the available data.} 
As discussed in \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017} and \cite{VasishthMertzenJaegerGelman2018}, low power and publication bias could be important factors that weaken the empirical claims. Appendix B of \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017} shows that power for many of the published studies on interference could be as low as 10-20\%. As \cite{GelmanCarlin2014} and many others before them have pointed out, low-power studies will not only fail to detect an effect under repeated sampling, but when an effect is found to be significant, it will be exaggerated in magnitude (Type M error) and can have the wrong sign (Type S error). It would therefore be worthwhile to re-evaluate the predictions of this extended LV05 model with larger-sample studies. 
\revisedII{For example, how do LV05's predictions fare in target-mismatch reflexives/reciprocals? In English reflexives, if we assume that gender marking on the reflexive \textit{himself/herself} is used as a retrieval cue to seek out an antecedent, the LV05 model predicts facilitatory interference effects in target-mismatch configurations. 
\cite{DillonMishlerSloggett2013} argued that the parser was immune to facilitatory interference based on a 40-subject study. A Bayesian reanalysis of their data \citep{JaegerMertzenVanDykeVasishth2019} shows a mean estimate of $-18$ ms, and Bayesian 95\% credible interval $[-72,36]$. This was a fairly low-powered study; as discussed in Appendix A of  \cite{JaegerMertzenVanDykeVasishth2019}, if the true effect size were to be $-23$ ms (the median effect predicted by LV05), then prospective power for a replication of their study would be about 13\%. This means that there is an approximately 87\% chance of obtaining a non-significant result even though the null hypothesis is false with this particular value for the effect size.
\cite{JaegerMertzenVanDykeVasishth2019} conducted a larger-sample replication attempt (181 subjects); power for the same effect size of $-23$ ms is about 42\%.
J\"ager and colleagues' larger sample study found a facilitatory interference effect of $-23$ ms, 95\% credible interval $[-48,2]$. This estimate turns out to be consistent with the LV05 model's predictions (under the assumption that gender is used as a retrieval cue in English reflexives). This example illustrates the need for obtaining more precise estimates of the effects of interest than we currently have. In \cite{VasishthMertzenJaegerGelman2018}, we provide further discussions of this general point about the adverse consequences of low power on developing an empirical base for theory testing, and provide constructive suggestions on how the situation could be improved.}

The data on non-agreement subject-verb dependencies agree overall with the general LV05 predictions --- inhibition in target-match configurations --- and thus had a good fit in both models. The picture is, however, incomplete since no data on target-mismatch configurations for this dependency type were available at the time of the \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017} meta-analysis and are thus not included in our simulations.
However, a recent study by \cite{CunningsSturt2018} showed evidence for a facilitatory effect in target-mismatch configurations in non-agreement subject-verb dependencies, which is predicted by LV05. 
They conducted two eyetracking while reading studies in which they manipulated the plausibility of the correct dependent of the verb, and the plausibility of the distractor noun. They showed that when the correct dependent is implausible, the distractor's plausibility influences reading time at the verb, such that a facilitation is observed. 
For example, faster total reading times were observed at the verb \textit{shattered} in \ref{ex:CunningsSturt2018}a compared to \ref{ex:CunningsSturt2018}b. 

\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:CunningsSturt2018}
\begin{xlist}
\item[a.] Sue remembered the letter that the butler with the cup accidentally shattered today in the dining room. 
\item[b.] Sue remembered the letter that the butler with the tie accidentally shattered today in the dining room. 
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Our own Bayesian estimate of their effect size in their Experiment 1 is $-22$ ms with a credible interval of $[-4,-42]$; for their Experiment 2, the estimate is $-19$ ms $[-40,1]$. These are consistent with both the original and extended LV05 model's predictions.

\revisedII{To summarize, Table~\ref{tab:resultsMeta1} suggested that the LV05 model makes the incorrect predictions for target-mismatch in reflexives and reciprocals, but the \cite{JaegerMertzenVanDykeVasishth2019} replication attempt indicates that the LV05 predictions may be correct. Furthermore, the \cite{CunningsSturt2018} data are consistent with the LV05 predictions for target-mismatch configurations in non-agreement subject-verb dependencies.}

A major contribution of the present work is 
that it spells out, for the first time, 
the predictions of the LV05 model with reference to all the evidence that was available from reading studies at the time of writing. The modeling presented here is highly constrained:
(i) The presented model is built on independently motivated --- and, in terms of ACT-R, domain-independently validated --- assumptions about memory retrieval, item prominence, and multi-associative cues, which are sensitive to experimental design choices; (ii) the model predictions are restricted by interactions between variables such as prominence, recency, and cue-feature cross-association; and (iii) the parameters are fixed within a given experiment, thus ruling out certain patterns of target-match and target-mismatch effects. 
An important prediction of the model in this respect is that the previously unexplained observations of facilitation in target-match or inhibition in target-mismatch can be explained under certain conditions, but,  as explained above, seeing both \textit{in the same experiment} is impossible according to the model's predictions.
Constrained predictions such as these are important because they make the theory falsifiable in principle.

As we have discussed above, the conclusions to be drawn about prominence and cue associations are preliminary because (i) the available data are sparse with respect to the levels of distractor prominence studied within dependency types and different levels of feature discrimination, (ii) there may be confounds between prominence and other factors, and (iii) there may be different cognitive processes involved in certain dependency types that the model does not account for.
In the following, we further discuss the implications of our approach for distractor prominence and cue-feature associations and potential alternatives.


\subsection{Distractor prominence}
In the model we have presented, the prominence of a distractor is a function of its syntactic position and discourse status.
An alternative account of how distractor position could affect the magnitude of interference has been discussed in \cite{VanDykeMcElree2011}. By way of a weighting mechanism, a mismatching syntactic feature would lower the consideration of a distractor as a retrieval candidate---or, with gating rather than weighting, even rule it out completely, irrespective of any matching semantic or pragmatic features. 
This account predicts that interference effects are very small or absent if a distractor does not match the syntactic requirement, e.g., of being a grammatical subject. 
The predictions of syntactic weighting are consistent with our prominence account and are also compatible with ACT-R in general and LV05 in particular. Because of its reduced activation, a distractor that mismatches the subject cue would have a very low probability of being retrieved instead of the target, and, thus, no facilitatory interference is expected in target-mismatch configurations. 
The fan effect in target-match configurations would not be directly affected,
because the fan effect in ACT-R is a consequence only of the feature that is manipulated between two conditions: The difference in the target activation between the distractor-match and the distractor-mismatch conditions is the same no matter how many additional cues the distractor matches across conditions.
However, an effect of syntactic match in target-match configurations would nevertheless be predicted on the basis of a generally lower activated target:
Because the relation between activation and latency in ACT-R is a negative exponential function (cf.\ Equation~\ref{eq:rt}), differences in activation have less impact on the retrieval speed for items with a higher activation than for items with a lower activation.
In case distractor and target both match the subject cue, the fan effect reduces \revised{the activation of} both  across conditions compared to the case when only the target matches the subject cue. As a consequence, when the distractor matches the subject cue, the retrieval latency of the target is more affected by the fan effect of a feature manipulation, i.e., a greater inhibitory interference effect is predicted in target-match configurations. 

Hence, the predictions of the syntactic weighting account regarding syntactic position are similar to the predictions of our prominence account: A distractor in subject position compared to object position increases the inhibitory interference effect in target-match configurations and the facilitatory effect in target-mismatch configurations. 
However, the predictions of syntactic weighting are only valid when it can be assumed that grammatical position is part of the retrieval cues. 
In contrast, the predictions of our prominence account are independent of cue combinatorics and the match quality of the distractor at retrieval. Instead, the predictions rest on the assumption that items in subject position have a higher relevance for interpreting a sentence and are, thus, maintained more actively in memory \citep{Chafe1976, KeenanComrie1977,grosz95, Brennan1995}. In the same way, this account of prominence can be extended to discourse status or other contributing factors that we have not considered here: For example, thematic role \citep{Arnold2001}, contrastive focus \citep{CowlesWalenskiKluender2007}, first mention \citep{GernsbacherHargreaves1988}, and animacy \citep{FukumuraVanGompel2011} are known to affect discourse saliency and might thus influence distractor prominence. 
% The results of our meta-analysis in \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017} and the simulations in the current article both suggest that the interference effect is more affected by discourse saliency than grammatical position. This is outside the scope of an account based on cue weighting.
Importantly, our account predicts a facilitatory effect in target-match configurations as a consequence of high distractor prominence. This cannot be explained in terms of cue combinatorics.





\subsection{Multi-associative cues}
The principle of multi-associative cues states that cues can be associated with multiple features to different degrees depending on experience with the linguistic context. Crossed cue-feature associations between two cues predict inhibitory interference in target-mismatch conditions for dependency environments with high feature-co-occurrence in comparison to environments with low feature-co-occurrence. 
This is based on the assumption that cue-feature associations are the result of associative learning through exposure to different dependency types and their grammatical antecedents. \revisedII{One way of describing the learning process could be along the lines of the naive discriminative learning model developed by \cite{BaayenMilinDJurdjevic2011}.}
\label{learningprocesspageref}
Their model is an implementation of the \cite{RescorlaWagner1972} equations for classical conditioning based on the presence and absence of cues and outcomes and has been applied to a range of effects in the context of language acquisition.

A possible way to test the multi-associative cues hypothesis for English in a controlled experiment would be to directly compare reflexives and reciprocals, manipulating the number cue in both.
An example design we have also suggested in \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2015} is shown in Example~\ref{ex:cueconf}.
%
\begin{exe}
\ex\label{ex:cueconf}
\begin{xlist}
\item  [a.] \textit{Reflexive; distractor-match}\\
The \textit{nurse} who cared for the \textit{children} had pricked \textit{themselves} \dots
\item  [b.] \textit{Reflexive; distractor-mismatch}\\
The \textit{nurse} who cared for the \textit{child} had pricked \textit{themselves} \dots
\item  [c.] \textit{Reciprocal; distractor-match}\\
The \textit{nurse} who cared for the \textit{children} had pricked \textit{each other} \dots
\item  [d.] \textit{Reciprocal; distractor-mismatch}\\
The \textit{nurse} who cared for the \textit{child} had pricked \textit{each other} \dots
\end{xlist}
\end{exe}  
%

Under the multi-associative cues hypothesis, a reduced facilitatory effect or an inhibitory effect is predicted for the reciprocal \textit{each other} compared to the reflexive \textit{themselves}.
%
In order to derive a finer-grained metric that predicts differences in cue-feature cross-association levels between different dependency environments, co-occurrence frequencies could be computed from a corpus in which sufficient dependency information is available.
%


Our theory of multi-associative cues predicts a higher cross-association level for both reciprocals and the Chinese reflexive \textit{ziji} compared to English reflexives. This could explain the result of \cite{KushPhillips2014}, who found inhibitory interference in target-mismatch conditions in Hindi reciprocals, as well as our finding of an inhibitory target-mismatch effect for \textit{ziji} in Experiment 1 of \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2015}.
The modeling results (Figure~\ref{fig:simresults}) showed that these two studies were sufficient to cause the average target-mismatch effect to be inhibitory in low and medium prominence reflexive/reciprocal studies. 
% However, the specific account of multi-associative cues pursued here does not account for the finding that 
According to the meta-analysis in \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2017}, the overall interference effect in target-mismatch configurations studies of reflexive- and reciprocal-antecedent dependencies is inhibitory  (see Table~\ref{tab:resultsMeta1}). Importantly, this overall inhibitory effect was found even when excluding the Chinese reflexives study of \cite{JaegerEngelmannVasishth2015}, which had a larger-than-usual sample size and could therefore have unduly influenced the meta-analysis.
Due to the two studies with cross-associated cues, the extended model predicted a tendency for an inhibitory effect on average in target-mismatch configurations, but not \revised{one as strong} as the meta-analysis found. 
A less conservative simulation with a freely varying cross-association parameter would, however, result in an overall increased cross-association level for reflexives compared to subject-verb agreement dependencies (subject-verb agreement showed an overall facilitatory effect in target-mismatch configurations).
In support for a theory of higher feature-co-occurrence and, thus, a higher cross-association level in reflexive-antecedent than in subject-verb dependencies in general, one could argue that reflexive-antecedent dependencies have a rather restrictive set of cues that define the target, whereas subject-verb dependencies occur in a wide range of contexts in which various semantic cues in addition to morpho-syntactic ones might be used \citep[cf.][]{VanDyke2006}.


Under a theory of multi-associative cues, an interesting question is whether categorically distinguishing two cues requires cognitive effort. If so, one would expect an additional variation of the cross-association level that depends on task demands and individual differences.
There is evidence that the depth of linguistic processing is influenced by task-specification \citep{SwetsDesmetClifton2008,LogacevVasishth2015} and individual differences \citep{Traxler2007,MalsburgVasishth2013,NicenboimEtAlFrontiers2016Capacity}, resulting in underspecification of sentence representations or ``good-enough processing'' \citep{FerreiraFerraroBailey2002}.
In the same way, multiple cue-feature associations could be part of a dynamically adapted resource-preserving strategy. 
This assumption predicts elevated cross-association levels for readers with less cognitive resources in order to compensate for slower processing. It also predicts increased cross-association for experiments with little task demand, like easy comprehension questions, because the effort of a precise cue specification would not be necessary.
There is one experiment on reflexives that controlled for participants' working memory capacity: \cite{CunningsFelser2013} found in their Experiment 2 on English reflexives an inhibitory effect on the critical region in target-mismatch conditions only for low-capacity readers. The effect has a very large standard error (mean 22 ms, SE 26 ms) but the sign of the estimated mean is consistent with the assumption of an individual-level variation of cue-feature associations due to adaptive processes. 
Note, however, that, even if it was the case that low-capacity readers experience higher cross-association, for reasons explained above, the current model could not predict an \textit{inhibitory} target-mismatch effect at the same time as a \textit{facilitatory} target-match effect as is the case in \cite{CunningsFelser2013}.
Since there is only one experiment testing low-capacity readers on target-mismatch configurations, a hypothesis of cue-feature associations being adaptive to individual capacity limits is currently speculative, and high-powered planned experiments should be carried out in order to test this hypothesis.

% \subsection{Cue strength}
Other factors besides feature-co-occurrence that affect the strength of cue associations have not been considered here.
Most prominently, it has been claimed that syntactic cues are weighted more strongly than semantic cues  \citep[e.g.,][]{Nicol1988, Sturt2003,VanDyke2007,VanDykeMcElree2011}. 
A stronger weighting for syntactic cues might actually be subsumed by co-occurrence, assuming that syntactic cues are more reliable (i.e., have a higher co-occurrence) in a certain construction than semantic cues.

Other associations may, however, go beyond pure co-occurrence. 
For example, an experiment conducted by \cite{VanDyke2006} showed interference effects based on similarities between nouns that tap into world knowledge, such as the property of being \emph{fixable}.
% In addition to markedness asymmetries within features such as plural vs.\ singular, a hierarchy between features (person > number > gender) has been proposed, e.g., by \cite{CarminatiNella2005}.
Some cues may be stronger than others based on their semantics and pragmatics: \cite{CarminatiNella2005} has proposed a hierarchy between features, such that \textit{person} > \textit{number} > \textit{gender}.
% \textit{Person} is supposedly a strong manipulation since it affects the speaker/listener perspective. 
% \citep{Wagers2009} have claimed that plural is more marked than singular or 
Additionally, in English, \textit{number} \revised{has a regular, general affixal realization on nouns and verbs whereas \textit{animacy} and \textit{gender} don't.} 
% Finally, binary features such as c-command, subject, or animacy could be stronger than features with more possible values such as gender (in English) or case.
The effects of semantically, pragmatically, or morphologically motivated differences between retrieval cues remain to be investigated.


\subsection{Some limitations of the present work} \label{limitations}

\revised{The principal goals of this work are to (a) evaluate the predictions of the Lewis and Vasishth 2005 (LV05) model against all available reading data, and (b) to propose a plausible account for the data-sets that the LV05 model cannot explain. In doing so, we proposed two new constructs, prominence and cue association. Introducing these new constructs obviously raises further questions as to the generality of their application. For example, in our discussion of prominence we have only considered how interference effects play out as a function of prominence, which is, perhaps over-simplistically, limited to subject-hood and discourse topic-hood.
\label{prominencelimitationspageref}
We have left underspecified how prominence might work more generally for co-reference resolution. As \cite{kaiser2008interpreting} showed, in a language like Finnish, pronouns and demonstratives exhibit different amounts of sensitivity to word order and syntactic role in determining the antecedent. Specifically, the Finnish pronoun \textit{h\"an}, `he/she,' prefers to choose syntactic subjects as an antecedent regardless of word order, but the demonstrative \textit{t\"am\"a}, `this,' is sensitive to both word order and syntactic role, so that object-verb-subject order would lead to an approximately equal preference for the object and the subject as antecedent, but subject-verb-object order would lead to a subject preference. Clearly, being able to account for pronouns vs.\ demonstratives in a cue-based architecture requires making the assumption that non-canonical word order makes fronted object nouns more prominent and that subjects are prominent even when they are not in sentence-initial position. Our work in this paper has nothing to say about what happens with non-canonical word order, where information structure plays a crucial role. However, we do not claim to provide a comprehensive theory or model of prominence in this paper.} 

\revised{Similarly, the idea of cue-association is proposed in the context of Hindi reciprocals and Chinese reflexives. How generally applicable is cue-association? Ideally, one should present independent evidence for this proposal, using an experiment design such as Example \ref{ex:cueconf} above. As we have discussed earlier, our proposal should be seen as a tentative one that needs empirical verification through appropriately powered studies.}






% TODOend: Modeling of working memory capacity

% Incorporates predictions of \cite{Gibson1998,Gibson2000,GrodnerGibson2005}, \cite{Hale2001,Levy2008}...


% This framework also provides a way to represent individual differences in working memory capacity, which has been done, e.g., by \cite{DailyLovettReder2001}.
% Finally, the most recent version of ACT-R provides an implementation of an eye movement control model called EMMA (eye movements and movements of attention, \citealp{Salvucci2001}), which is a domain-independent vision module defining the processes of saccade planning and execution initiated by an attention shift in a similar way as E-Z Reader.



% %%% topics %%%
% To summarize, the sentence processing model of \citeauthor{LewisVasishth2005} is a fully-specified parser the actions of which can be transparently measured in milliseconds. It relies on domain-independent memory principles,  and it is well-tested by a number of applications.  This kind of model is exactly what is needed in order to investigate the interaction between parsing and eye movements in detail. We connect this parsing model to EMMA via Time Out\index{time out} regressions.
