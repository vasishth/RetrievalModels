			abstract = {Individuals with agrammatic Broca's aphasia experience difficulty when processing reversible non-canonical sentences.  Different accounts have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. The Trace Deletion account attributes this deficit to an impairment in syntactic representations, whereas others propose that the underlying structural representations are unimpaired, but sentence comprehension is affected by processing deficits, such as slow lexical activation, reduction in memory resources, slowed processing and/or intermittent deficiency,  among others. We test the claims of two processing accounts, slowed processing and intermittent deficiency, and two versions of the Trace Deletion Hypothesis, in a computational framework for sentence processing  implemented in ACT-R. The assumption of slowed processing is operationalized as slow procedural memory, so that each processing action is performed slower than normal, and intermittent deficiency as extra noise in the procedural memory, so that the parsing steps are more noisy than normal. We operationalize the Trace Deletion Hypothesis as an absence of trace information in the parse tree. To test the predictions of the models implementing these theories, we use the data from a German sentence-picture matching study reported in \citeA{Hanne-EtAl-2011}. The data consists of offline (sentence-picture matching accuracies and response times) and online (eye fixation proportions) measures. From among the models considered, the model assuming that both slowed processing and intermittent deficiency are present emerges as the best model of  sentence processing difficulty in aphasia. The modeling of individual differences suggests that, if we assume that patients have both slowed processing and intermittent deficiency, they have them in differing degrees.},

We discuss a computational model (in ACT-R, Anderson, 2007) to explain how referring expressions are acquired and used. On the basis of simulations of this model, it is predicted that WM constraints only affect adults' pronoun resolution in stories with a topic shift, but not in stories without a topic shift. This latter prediction was tested in an experiment. The results of this experiment confirm that WM load reduces adults' sensitivity to discourse cues signaling a topic shift, thus influencing their interpretation of subsequent pronouns.},

	Abstract = {Eye movement data have proven to be very useful for investigating human sentence processing. Eyetracking research has addressed a wide range of questions, such as recovery mechanisms following garden-pathing, the timing of processes driving comprehension, the role of anticipation and expectation in parsing, the role of semantic, pragmatic, and prosodic information, and so on. However, there are some limitations regarding the inferences that can be made on the basis of eye movements. One relates to the nontrivial interaction between parsing and the eye movement control system which complicates the interpretation of eye movement data. Detailed computational models that integrate parsing with eye movement control theories have the potential to unpack the complexity of eye movement data and can therefore aid in the interpretation of eye movements. Another limitation is the difficulty of capturing spatiotemporal patterns in eye movements using the traditional word-based eyetracking measures. Recent research has demonstrated the relevance of these patterns and has shown how they can be analyzed. In this review, we focus on reading, and present examples demonstrating how eye move- ment data reveal what events unfold when the parser runs into difficulty, and how the parsing system interacts with eye movement control.},

	Abstract = {
Five experiments measured reading time for Spanish and English sentences containing a complex NP followed by a relative clause (e.g., {\ldots} ``the daughter of the colonel who had an accident''). As has been previously reported, Spanish sentences were read more rapidly when the content of the relative clause forced it to modify the first of the two NPs in the complex NP (``the daughter'') than when it modified the second NP (``the colonel''). Their English translations showed no difference in reading time. This preference to take the first noun as a host for the relative clause in Spanish occurred whether the relative clause was disambiguated by morphological gender marking or by its content. The results are generally consistent with the claim that the Late Closure parsing strategy does not apply universally across languages. However, we propose an alternative hypothesis, namely, that the Late Closure parsing strategy fails to apply across all phrase types within a language, and applies to relative clauses in neither English nor Spanish. Instead, a different principle, which we term the ``construal hypothesis'', accounts for processing of phrases such as relative clauses which do not play the role of a ``primary relation'' within a sentence.

@article{NicenboimRetrieval2018,
	Abstract = {Research on similarity-based interference has provided extensive evidence that the formation of dependencies between non-adjacent words relies on a cue-based retrieval mechanism. There are two different models that can account for one of the main predictions of interference, i.e., a slowdown at a retrieval site, when several items share a feature associated with a retrieval cue: Lewis and Vasishth's (2005) activation-based model and McElree's (2000) direct access model. Even though these two models have been used almost interchangeably, they are based on different assumptions and predict differences in the relationship between reading times and response accuracy. The activation-based model follows the assumptions of the ACT-R framework, and its retrieval process behaves as a lognormal race between accumulators of evidence with a single variance. Under this model, accuracy of the retrieval is determined by the winner of the race and retrieval time by its rate of accumulation. In contrast, the direct access model assumes a model of memory where only the probability of retrieval can be affected, while the retrieval time is constant; in this model, differences in latencies are a by-product of the possibility of backtracking and repairing incorrect retrievals. We implemented both models in a Bayesian hierarchical framework in order to evaluate them and compare them. We show that some aspects of the data are better fit under the direct access model than under the activation-based model. We suggest that this finding does not rule out the possibility that retrieval may be behaving as a race model with assumptions that follow less closely the ones from the ACT-R framework. We show that by introducing a modification of the activation model, i.e, by assuming that the accumulation of evidence for retrieval of incorrect items is not only slower but noisier (i.e., different variances for the correct and incorrect items), the model can provide a fit as good as the one of the direct access model.},

This autocorrelational structure is likely to be a consequence of learning, fatigue, or the ebb and flow of attention within an experiment (the `human factor'). Unlike molecules or plots of barley, subjects in psycholinguistic experiments are intelligent beings that depend for their survival on constant adaptation to their environment, including the environment of an experiment. Three data sets illustrate that the human factor may interact with predictors of interest, both factorial and metric. We also show that, especially within the framework of the generalized additive model, in the nonlinear world, fitting maximally complex models that take every possible contingency into account is ill-advised as a modeling strategy. Alternative modeling strategies are discussed for both confirmative and exploratory data analysis.},

@article{hannesBEAP,
	Abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models have increasingly replaced mixed-model analyses of variance for statistical inference in factorial psycholinguistic experiments. The advantages of LMMs over ANOVAs, however, come at a cost: Setting up an LMM is not as straightforward as running an ANOVA. One simple option, when numerically possible, is to fit the full variance-covariance structure of random effects (the maximal model; Barr et al., 2013), presumably to keep Type I error down to the nominal {$\alpha$} in the presence of random effects. Although it is true that fitting a model with only random intercepts may lead to higher Type I error, fitting a maximal model also has a cost: it can lead to a significant loss of power. We demonstrate this with simulations and suggest that for typical psychological and psycholinguistic data, models with a random effect structure that is supported by the data have optimal Type I error and power properties.},

@article{focusHindi08,
	Abstract = {A production study is presented that investigates the effects of word order and information structural
	context on the prosodic realization of declarative sentences in Hindi. Previous work on Hindi intonation
	has shown that: (i) non-final content words bear rising pitch accents (Moore 1965, Dyrud 2001, Nair
	1999); (ii) focused constituents show greater pitch excursion and longer duration and that post-focal
	material undergoes pitch range reduction (Moore 1965, Harnsberger 1994, Harnsberger and Judge
	1996); and (iii) focused constituents may be followed by a phrase break (Moore 1965). By means of
	a controlled experiment, we investigated the effect of focus in relation to word order variation using
	1200 utterances produced by 20 speakers. Fundamental frequency (F0) and duration of constituents
	were measured in Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) and Object-Subject-Verb (OSV) sentences in different
	information structural conditions (wide focus, subject focus and object focus). The analyses indicate
	that (i) regardless of word order and focus, the constituents are in a strict downstep relationship;
	(ii) focus is mainly characterized by post-focal pitch range reduction rather than pitch raising of the
	element in focus; (iii) given expressions that occur pre-focally appear to undergo no reduction; (iv)
	pitch excursion and duration of the constituents is higher in OSV compared to SOV sentences. A

 @article{Grodzinsky:2000,
	Abstract = {A new view of the functional role of the left anterior cortex in language use is proposed. The experimental record indicates that most human linguistic abilities are not localized in this region. In particular, most of syntax (long thought to be there) is not located in Broca's area and its vicinity (operculum, insula, and subjacent white matter). This cerebral region, implicated in Broca's aphasia, does have a role in syntactic processing, but a highly specific one: It is the neural home to receptive mechanisms involved in the computation of the relation between transformationally moved phrasal constituents and their extraction sites (in line with the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis). It is also involved in the construction of higher parts of the syntactic tree in speech production. By contrast, basic combinatorial capacities necessary for language processing--for example, structure-building operations, lexical insertion--are not supported by the neural tissue of this cerebral region, nor is lexical or combinatorial semantics. The dense body of empirical evidence supporting this restrictive view comes mainly from several angles on lesion studies of syntax in agrammatic Broca's aphasia. Five empirical arguments are presented: experiments in sentence comprehension, cross-linguistic considerations (where aphasia findings from several language types are pooled and scrutinized comparatively), grammaticality and plausibility judgments, real-time processing of complex sentences, and rehabilitation. Also discussed are recent results from functional neuroimaging and from structured observations on speech production of Broca's aphasics. Syntactic abilities are nonetheless distinct from other cognitive skills and are represented entirely and exclusively in the left cerebral hemisphere. Although more widespread in the left hemisphere than previously thought, they are clearly distinct from other human combinatorial and intellectual abilities. The neurological record (based on functional imaging, split-brain and right-hemisphere-damaged patients, as well as patients suffering from a breakdown of mathematical skills) indicates that language is a distinct, modularly organized neurological entity. Combinatorial aspects of the language faculty reside in the human left cerebral hemisphere, but only the transformational component (or algorithms that implement it in use) is located in and around Broca's area.},

	Abstract = {We report on three experiments that provide a real-time processing perspective on the poor comprehension of Broca's aphasic patients for non-canonically structured sentences. In the first experiment we presented sentences (via a Cross Modal Lexical Priming (CMLP) paradigm) to Broca's patients at a normal rate of speech. Unlike the pattern found with unimpaired control participants, we observed a general slowing of lexical activation and a concomitant delay in the formation of syntactic dependencies involving "moved" constituents and empty elements. Our second experiment presented these same sentences at a slower rate of speech. In this circumstance, Broca's patients formed syntactic dependencies as soon as they were structurally licensed (again, a different pattern from that demonstrated by the unimpaired control group). The third experiment used a sentence-picture matching paradigm to chart Broca's comprehension for non-canonically structured sentences (presented at both normal and slow rates). Here we observed significantly better scores in the slow rate condition. We discuss these findings in terms of the functional commitment of the left anterior cortical region implicated in Broca's aphasia and conclude that this region is crucially involved in the formation of syntactically-governed dependency relations, not because it supports knowledge of syntactic dependencies, but rather because it supports the real-time implementation of these specific representations by sustaining, at the least, a lexical activation rise-time parameter.},

	Abstract = {Two experiments were conducted exploring on-line processing of filler-gap construction in aphasia. An auditory-auditory lexical decision paradigm was used to investigate whether Broca's and Wernicke's aphasic patients show, as do normals, reactivation of the filler at the gap site. Experiment I investigated the processing of a number of filler-gap constructions including wh-questions, relative clauses as subject, relative clauses as object, and embedded wh-questions. Broca's aphasics showed reactivation of the filler at the gap site, whereas Wernicke's aphasics did not. Experiment II examined object relative clauses and their processing by Broca's aphasics. In addition, we investigated whether the presence (or absence) of the relative pronoun played any role in on-line processing. Broca's aphasics performed as did normals. In addition, their performance was unaffected by the presence or absence of the relative pronoun. The results of these experiments suggest that Broca's aphasics do not have an impairment in processing or representing thematic relationships of NP arguments to predicates or relating traces to their antecedents.},

@article{Prather:1997,
	Abstract = {Rapid, automatic access to lexical/semantic knowledge is critical in supporting the tight temporal constraints of on-line sentence comprehension. Based on findings of "abnormal" lexical priming in nonfluent aphasics, the question of disrupted automatic lexical activation has been the focus of many recent efforts to understand their impaired sentence comprehension capabilities. The picture that emerges from this literature is, however, unclear. Nonfluent Broca's aphasic patients show inconsistent, not absent, lexical priming, and there is little consensus about the conditions under which they do and do not prime. The most parsimonious explanation for the variable findings from priming studies to date is that the primary disturbance in Broca's lexical activation has something to do with speed of activation. Broca's aphasic patients prime when sufficient time is allowed for activation to spread among associates. To examine this "slowed activation" hypothesis, the time course of lexical activation was examined using a list priming paradigm. Temporal delays between successive words ranged from 300 to 2100 msec. One nonfluent Broca's aphasic patient and one fluent Wernicke's patient were tested. Both patients displayed abnormal priming patterns, though of different sorts. In contrast to elderly subjects, who prime at relatively short interstimulus intervals (ISIs) beginning at 500 msec, the Broca's aphasic subject showed reliable automatic priming but only at a long ISI of 1500 msec. That is, this subject retained the ability to access lexical information automatically if allowed sufficient time to do so, a finding that may help explain disrupted comprehension of normally rapid conversational speech. The Wernicke's aphasic subject, in contrast, showed normally rapid initial activation but continued to show priming over an abnormally long range of delays, from 300 msec through 1100 msec. This protracted priming suggests failure to dampen activation and might explain the semantic confusion exhibited by fluent Wernicke's patients.},

@article{hanneetal11,
	Abstract = {Background: In addition to the canonical subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, German also allows for non-canonical order (OVS), and the case-marking system supports thematic role interpretation. Previous eye-tracking studies (Kamide et al., 2003; Knoeferle, 2007) have shown that unambiguous case information in non-canonical sentences is processed incrementally. For individuals with agrammatic aphasia, comprehension of non-canonical sentences is at chance level (Burchert et al., 2003). The trace deletion hypothesis (Grodzinsky 1995, 2000) claims that this is due to structural impairments in syntactic representations, which force the individual with aphasia (IWA) to apply a guessing strategy. However, recent studies investigating online sentence processing in aphasia (Caplan et al., 2007; Dickey et al., 2007) found that divergences exist in IWAs' sentence-processing routines depending on whether they comprehended non-canonical sentences correctly or not, pointing rather to a processing deficit explanation. 
	Aims: The aim of the current study was to investigate agrammatic IWAs' online and offline sentence comprehension simultaneously in order to reveal what online sentence-processing strategies they rely on and how these differ from controls' processing routines. We further asked whether IWAs' offline chance performance for non-canonical sentences does indeed result from guessing. 
	Methods & Procedures: We used the visual-world paradigm and measured eye movements (as an index of online sentence processing) of controls (N = 8) and individuals with aphasia (N = 7) during a sentence-picture matching task. Additional offline measures were accuracy and reaction times. 
	Outcomes & Results: While the offline accuracy results corresponded to the pattern predicted by the TDH, IWAs' eye movements revealed systematic differences depending on the response accuracy. 
	Conclusions: These findings constitute evidence against attributing IWAs' chance performance for non-canonical structures to mere guessing. Instead, our results support processing deficit explanations and characterise the agrammatic parser as deterministic and inefficient: it is slowed down, affected by intermittent deficiencies in performing syntactic operations, and fails to compute reanalysis even when one is detected.},

		  the changing context of the interaction or dialogue.
		  Abduction is used in a number of ways. It is used to

		  perform various kinds of reasoning such as default
		  reasoning, and planning of the next knowledge state, via
		  the use of additional predicates such as "abnormal" and

	Abstract = {Understanding a sentence and integrating it into the discourse depends upon the identification of its focus, which, in spoken German, is marked by accentuation. In the case of written language, which lacks explicit cues to accent, readers have to draw on other kinds of information to determine the focus.
We study the joint or interactive effects of two kinds of information that have no direct representation in print but have each been shown to be influential in the reader's text comprehension: i. the (low-level) rhythmic-prosodic structure that is based on the distribution of lexically stressed syllables, and ii. the (high-level) discourse context that is grounded in the memory of previous linguistic content.
Systematically manipulating these factors, we examine the way readers resolve a syntactic ambiguity involving the scopally ambiguous focus operator auch (engl. `too') in both oral (Experiment 1) and silent reading (Experiment 2).
The results of both experiments attest that discourse context and local linguistic rhythm conspire to guide the syntactic and, concomitantly, the focus-structural analysis of ambiguous sentences. We argue that reading comprehension requires the (implicit) assignment of accents according to the focus structure and that, by establishing a prominence profile, the implicit prosodic rhythm directly affects accent assignment.},

	Abstract = {The Trace-Deletion Hypothesis (henceforth TDH; Grodzinsky 1986, 1995) states that syntactic traces are deleted in agrammatism and that whenever a trace is deleted, a default strategy is activated. The default strategy assigns the role of Agent to the first NP. In structures where a second NP receives the Agent role syntactically, the consequence is that the agrammatic representation contains two conflicting Agents for the same action. This is the mechanism that induces guessing and the random performance on comprehension tests that has often been observed for passives and certain other structures. In this paper, we isolate the default strategy of the TDH, using a sentence-picture matching task in which one of the pictures matches the meaning arrived at by the default strategy. Our results show that an agrammatic representation does not involve double-Agents, and thus the default strategy (and therefore the TDH) is refuted.},

This research suggests that this generalization may not be true across languages: the distance between arguments and verbs could affect the ease with which the former can be integrated with the latter, and sufficiently increasing this distance makes processing difficult, regardless of discourse context.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a study of syntactically based comprehension in aphasic patients. We studied 42 patients with aphasia secondary to left hemisphere strokes and 25 control participants. We measured off-line, end-of-sentence, performance (accuracy and reaction time) in two tasks that require comprehension--enactment and sentence-picture matching--and in grammaticality judgment, with whole sentence auditory presentation. We also used sentence-picture matching and grammaticality judgment as tasks in two self-paced listening studies with the same patients to measure on-line performance. In each task and presentation format, we presented sentences that tested the ability to assign and interpret three structural contrasts chosen to examine different basic syntactic operations: actives and passives, subject and object extracted relative clauses, and reflexive pronouns and matched sentences without these elements. We examined these behavioral data to determine patterns of impairment in individual patients and in groups of patients, using correlational analyses, factor analyses, and analyses of variance. The results showed that almost no individual patients had stable deficits referable to the ability to interpret individual syntactic structures, that a variety of structural features contributed to sentence processing complexity both on-line and off-line, that correct responses were associated with normal on-line and errors with abnormal performance, and that the major determinant of performance is a factor that affected performance on all sentence types. The results indicate that the major cause of aphasic impairments of syntactically based comprehension are intermittent reductions in the processing capacity available for syntactic, interpretive, and task-related operations.},

	Abstract = {We report a comprehensive review of the published reading studies on retrieval interference in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent and subject-verb dependencies. We also provide a quantitative random-effects meta-analysis of self-paced and eyetracking reading studies. We show that the empirical evidence is only partly consistent with cue-based retrieval as implemented in the ACT-R-based model of sentence processing by Lewis \& Vasishth 2005 (LV05) and that there are important differences between the reviewed dependency types. In non-agreement subject-verb dependencies, there is evidence for inhibitory interference in configurations where the correct dependent fully matches the retrieval cues. This is consistent with the LV05 cue-based retrieval account. By contrast, in subject-verb agreement as well as in reflexive-/reciprocal-antecedent dependencies, no evidence for interference is found in configurations with a fully cue-matching subject. In configurations with only a partially cue-matching subject or antecedent, the meta-analysis revealed facilitatory interference in subject-verb agreement and inhibitory interference in reflexives/reciprocals. The former is consistent with the LV05 account, but the latter is not. Moreover, the meta-analysis revealed that  (i) interference type (proactive versus retroactive) leads to different effects in the reviewed dependency types; and (ii) the prominence of the distractor has an important impact on the interference effect. 
In sum, the meta-analysis suggests that the LV05 needs important modifications to account for (i) the unexplained interference patterns and (ii) the differences between the dependency types. More generally, the meta-analysis provides a quantitative empirical basis for comparing the predictions of competing accounts of retrieval processes in sentence comprehension.},

The empirically oriented researcher will benefit from making Bayesian methods part of their statistical toolkit due to the many advantages of this framework, among them easier interpretation of results relative to research hypotheses, and flexible model specification. We present an informal introduction to the foundational ideas behind Bayesian data analysis, using, as an example, a linear mixed models analysis of data from a typical psycholinguistics experiment. We discuss hypothesis testing using the Bayes factor, and model selection using cross-validation. We close with some examples illustrating the flexibility of model specification in the Bayesian framework. Suggestions for further reading are also provided.},

Recently, Husain et al (2014) suggested that when the exact identity of the upcoming verb is predictable (strong predictability), increasing argument-verb distance leads to facilitation effects, which is consistent with surprisal; but when the exact identity of the upcoming verb is not predictable (weak predictability), locality effects are seen. We investigated Husain et al.'s proposal using Persian complex predicates (CPs), which consist of a non-verbal element---a noun in the current study---and a verb. In CPs, once the noun has been read, the exact identity of the verb is highly predictable (strong predictability); this was confirmed using a sentence completion study. In two self-paced reading (SPR) and two eye-tracking (ET) experiments, we delayed the appearance of the verb by interposing a relative clause (Expt. 1 and 3) or a long PP (Expt. 2 and 4). 
We also included a simple Noun-Verb predicate configuration with the same distance manipulation; here, the exact identity of the verb was not predictable (weak predictability). Thus, the design crossed Predictability Strength and Distance.  We found that, consistent with surprisal, the verb in the strong predictability conditions was read faster than in the weak predictability conditions. Furthermore, greater verb-argument distance led to slower reading times;  strong predictability did not neutralize or attenuate the locality effects. As regards the effect of distance on dependency resolution difficulty, these four experiments  present evidence in favor of  working memory accounts of argument-verb dependency resolution, and against the surprisal-based expectation account of Levy (2008). However, another expectation-based measure, entropy, which was computed using the offline sentence completion data, predicts reading times in Experiment 1. We suggest that forgetting due to memory overload leads to greater entropy at the verb.},

	Abstract = {This article reports on a crosslinguistic comparative study of the processing of Japanese relative clauses (RCs) by Chinese-, Sinhalese-, Vietnamese-, Thai-, and Indonesian-speaking second language (L2) learners. A robust finding in studies on the acquisition of RCs in L2 English and other European languages is that subject-gap RCs are easier than object-gap RCs, both in production and comprehension. However, in the case of L2 Japanese studies, the picture does not seem to be as clear as in the English case. This study identifies some factors that might contribute to this situation. The results of a listening comprehension test involving reversible and nonreversible test sentences show that the five groups of learners overall found subject-gap RCs easier to process than object-gap RCs, but that their performances are poor and vary for sentence types in which no semantic cue is available to help identify the grammatical function of the overt noun phrase in RCs, yielding inconclusive results with respect to the question of whether subject-gap RCs are easier than object-gap RCs. Results indicate that when RCs are too difficult for learners to process, first language properties such as head direction, word order, and the relative order of filler and gap affect the manner in which they are interpreted.},

This paper seeks to resolve this issue and to extend our understanding of SLA in general by investigating the interpretation of subject and direct object relative clauses by English-speaking learners of Korean, a left-branching language in which subject gaps in relative clauses are more distant from the head than are object gaps. The results of a comprehension task conducted with 53 beginning and intermediate learners point toward a strong preference for subject relative clauses, favoring the structural account.},

@article{Chen238998,
	Abstract = {In neuroimaging, the multiplicity issue may sneak into data analysis through several channels, affecting expected false positive rates (FPRs; type I errors) in diverse ways. One widely recognized aspect of multiplicity, multiple testing, occurs when the investigator fits a separate model for each voxel in the brain. However, multiplicity also occurs when the investigator conducts multiple comparisons within a model, tests two tails of a t-test separately when prior information is unavailable about the directionality, and branches in the analytic pipelines. The current practice of handling multiple testing through controlling the overall FPR in neuroimaging under the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm excessively penalizes the statistical power with inflated type II errors. More fundamentally, the adoption of dichotomous decisions through sharp thresholding under NHST may not be appropriate when the null hypothesis itself is not pragmatically relevant because the effect of interest takes a continuum instead of discrete values and is not expected to be null in most brain regions. When the noise inundates the signal, two different types of error are more relevant than the concept of FPR: incorrect sign (type S) and incorrect magnitude (type M). In light of these considerations, we introduce a different strategy using Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BHM) to achieve two goals: 1) improving modeling efficiency via one integrative (instead of many separate) model and dissolving the multiple testing issue, and 2) turning the focus of conventional NHST on FPR into quality control by calibrating type S errors while maintaining a reasonable level of inference efficiency. The performance and validity of this approach are demonstrated through an application at the region of interest (ROI) level, with all the regions on an equal footing: unlike the current approaches under NHST, small regions are not disadvantaged simply because of their physical size. In addition, compared to the massively univariate approach, BHM may simultaneously achieve increased spatial specificity and inference efficiency. The benefits of BHM are illustrated in model performance and quality checking using an experimental dataset. In addition, BHM offers an alternative, confirmatory, or complementary approach to the conventional whole brain analysis under NHST, and promotes results reporting in totality and transparency. The methodology also avoids sharp and arbitrary thresholding in the p-value funnel to which the multidimensional data are reduced. The modeling approach with its auxiliary tools will be available as part of the AFNI suite for general use.},

	Abstract = {A general fact about language is that subject relative clauses are easier to process than object relative clauses. Recently, several self-paced reading studies have presented surprising evidence that object relatives in Chinese are easier to process than subject relatives. We carried out three self-paced reading experiments that attempted to replicate these results. Two of our three studies found a subject-relative preference, and the third study found an object-relative advantage. Using a random effects Bayesian meta-analysis of fifteen studies (including our own), we show that the overall current evidence for the subject-relative advantage is quite strong (approximate posterior probability of a subject-relative advantage given the data: 78--80%). We argue that retrieval/integration based accounts would have difficulty explaining all three experimental results. These findings are important because they narrow the theoretical space by limiting the role of an important class of explanation---retrieval/integration cost---at least for relative clause processing in Chinese.},

	Abstract = {Two Hindi eyetracking studies show that clefting a noun results in greater processing difficulty initially,
	due to the extra processing steps involved in encoding a clefted noun (e.g., for computing the
	exhaustiveness interpretation). However, this extra difficulty in encoding a clefted noun results in a
	processing advantage when the clefted noun needs to be retrieved later on in the sentence -- the clefted
	noun is retrieved faster in subsequent processing compared to its non-clefted counterpart. This effect
	is short-lived, however; it does not last beyond the current sentence. We also show that given-new
	ordering yields a processing advantage over new-given order, but this is only seen after the whole
	sentence is processed, i.e., it is a late effect that occurs after syntactic processing is completed. Finally,
	following up on work on German by Hoernig et al. (2005), we present evidence that non-canonical order
	can be processed more easily than canonical order given appropriate context.},

	Abstract = {Three experiments (self-paced reading, eyetracking and an
	ERP study) show that in relative clauses, increasing the distance be
	tween the relativized noun and the relative-clause verb makes it more
	difficult to process the relative-clause verb (the so-called locality effect).
	This result is consistent with the predictions of several theories (Gibson 2000, Lewis and Vasishth 2005), and contradicts the recent claim
	(Levy 2008) that in relative-clause structures increasing argument-verb
	distance makes processing easier at the verb. Levy's expectation-based
	account predicts that the expectation for a verb becomes sharper as dis-
	tance is increased and therefore processing becomes easier at the verb.
	We argue that, in addition to expectation effects (which are seen in the
	eyetracking study in first-pass regression probability), processing load
	also increases with increasing distance. This contradicts Levy's claim
	that heightened expectation leads to lower processing cost. Dependency-
	resolution cost and expectation-based facilitation are jointly responsible
	for determining processing cost.},

	Abstract = {Scanpaths have played an important role in classic research on reading behavior. Nevertheless, they have largely been neglected in later research---perhaps also due to a lack of suitable analytical tools. Recently, von der Malsburg and Vasishth (2011) proposed a new measure for quantifying differences between scanpaths and demonstrated that this measure can recover effects that were missed with the traditional eyetracking measures. However, the sentences used in that study were difficult to process and scanpath effects accordingly strong. The purpose of the present study was to test the validity, sensitivity, and scope of applicability of the scanpath measure using simple sentences that are typically read straight from left to right. We derived predictions for the regularity of scanpaths from the literature on oculomotor control, sentences processing, and cognitive aging and tested these predictions using the scanpath measure and a large database of eye movements (N=230). All predictions were confirmed: sentences with short words and syntactically more difficult sentences elicited more irregular scanpaths. Also, older readers produced more irregular scanpaths than younger readers. In addition, we found an effect that was not reported earlier: syntax had a smaller influence on the eye movements of older readers than on those of young readers. We discuss this interaction of syntactic parsing cost with age in terms of shifts in processing strategies and a decline of executive control as readers age. Overall, our results demonstrate the validity and sensitivity of the scanpath measure and thus establish it as a productive and versatile tool for reading research.},

		switch between objects (object effect), and to the attraction of
		attention towards the display centroid (attraction effect), taking
		also into account the design-inherent imbalance of valid and other

		of subject-related random effects for these spatial, object, and
		attraction effects in addition to their mean RTs. The spatial effect
		showed a strong positive correlation with mean RT and a strong negative
		correlation with the attraction effect. The analysis of individual
		differences suggests that slow subjects engage attention more strongly

	Abstract = {Previous work (Boston et al., 2011) has shown that surprisal (Hale, 2001) and retrieval difficulty (Lewis \& Vasishth, 2005) are significant predictors of reading time in the Potsdam Sentence Corpus (PSC). It remains an open question how such measures of parsing difficulty interact with eye movement control processes (Reichle et al., 2009). We investigate this interaction using the eye movement control model EMMA (Salvucci, 2001), a serial attention shift model similar to E-Z Reader, which is integrated in the cognitive architecture ACT-R. Several simulation studies are presented that explore the possibilities of incorporating surprisal and retrieval in an ACT- R/EMMA model. The ACT-R model interacts with EMMA by shifting attention from word to word. The model includes a post-lexical integration stage inspired by Reichle et al. (2009), that triggers short regressions on high difficulty. A baseline study evaluates the performance of the latest EMMA implementation in ACT-R 6.0 on the sentences of the English Schilling Corpus, thereby replicating the original study by Salvucci (2001) in the latest version of the ACT-R architectural environment. The model reproduces effects of word frequency for gaze duration, first fixation duration, single fixation duration, and the probabilities of skipping, one fixation, and two+ fixations (mean correlation r = 0.96, RMSD = 0.220). In a second simulation the same model is applied to the German Potsdam Sentence Corpus (r = 0.89, RMSD = 0.285). Further simulations include surprisal, retrieval, and both, respectively, and are qualitatively evaluated on data of the PSC. Retrieval values (calculated by Boston, 2011, under independently motivated assumptions of ACT-R theory) are used to define the duration of the integration stage. Surprisal was tested in different configurations: (a) modulating integration time and (b) directly integrated in EMMA's equation of word encoding time. Configuration (b) is motivated by experimental and corpus work (e.g., Boston, 2011; Vasishth \& Drenhaus, 2011) suggesting that surprisal may show early effects in the eye movement record more reliably than retrieval does. Our implementation of surprisal and retrieval, although resting on simplified assumptions, enables the model to reproduce general effects of both measures on reading time as observed in the PSC data (retrieval: r = 0.67, RMSD = 0.156; surprisal[b]: r = 0.81, RMSD = 0.309). The model predictions for frequency effects improve with the incorporation of surprisal[a] (RMSD = 0.232), retrieval (RMSD = 0.200) and in a model containing both predictors (RMSD = 0.199). The overall goodness of fit for word-by-word gaze duration improves only when surprisal is included (r = 0.45, RMSD = 0.983, vs. for the baseline: r = 0.39, RMSD 0.991). This work provides a first qualitative demonstration of an integrated, flexible framework incorporating two complementary measures of parsing difficulty interacting with eye movement control on different levels. It serves as a foundational step for future work on a precise investigation of the interactions between high- level language processing and eye movements.},

@article{Grodzinsky:1995,
	Abstract = {In this paper I propose a new, restrictive theory of Trace-Deletion in agrammatism. This theory subsumes the Trace-Deletion Hypothesis (TDH; Grodzinsky, 1984a,b, 1986, 1990), which maintains that traces are deleted from agrammatic representations and that a cognitive strategy augments the patients' performance. This claim accounts for the pattern of loss and sparing observed in these patients' comprehension of a wide variety of syntactic constructions and is thus important for our understanding of the neural representation of syntax. Yet there are reasons for revising the account and making it more precise, stemming from both recent empirical findings and new developments in the theory of syntax. The original TDH was based on observations of agrammatic comprehension of structures containing traces resulting from either NP- or Wh-movement. Nevertheless, heads (as opposed to phrasal projections) also move and leave traces behind. Head movement (of verbs, for instance) has come to play a central role in linguistic theory (which currently postulates a wider variety of empty categories than any previous theoretical framework). Recent findings suggest that verb movement is retained in agrammatism, indicating that a sweeping claim regarding the deletion of all empty categories is too strong. This motivates the first restrictive move, resulting in a theory that picks out a restricted set of traces--only those for which deficient performance is indeed observed. All other empty categories are left intact. Trace-Deletion is tied to theta-positions. The second restrictive move is motivated by two types of surprising asymmetries that have recently been discovered for agrammatic comprehenders: First, agrammatic comprehension on passives of psychological predicates provides an error pattern that distinguishes this construction from agentive passive, indicating that the deficit is tied to the thematic properties of the predicate: Second, asymmetries have been observed in agrammatic comprehension of questions and quantifiers. These findings motivate a modification of the augmentative strategy, whose domain of application is restricted to referential NPs. Thus, the new account amounts to the claim that only traces in theta-positions are deleted, and that the strategy applies to referential NPs alone. This, I argue, not only derives all the data precisely but is also conceptually superior to any previous account of agrammatism. Finally, I discuss the consequences of this account to linguistic theory, and to theories of brain/language relations.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Theories of comprehension deficits in Broca's aphasia have largely been based on the pattern of deficit found with movement constructions. However, some studies have found comprehension deficits with binding constructions, which do not involve movement. AIMS: This study investigates online processing and offline comprehension of binding constructions, such as reflexive (e.g., himself) and pronoun (e.g., him) constructions in unimpaired and aphasic individuals in an attempt to evaluate theories of agrammatic comprehension. METHODS \#ENTITYSTARTX00026; PROCEDURES: Participants were eight individuals with agrammatic Broca's aphasia and eight age-matched unimpaired individuals. We used eyetracking to examine online processing of binding constructions while participants listened to stories. Offline comprehension was also tested. OUTCOMES \#ENTITYSTARTX00026; RESULTS: The eye movement data showed that individuals with Broca's aphasia were able to automatically process the correct antecedent of reflexives and pronouns. In addition, their syntactic processing of binding was not delayed compared to normal controls. Nevertheless, offline comprehension of both pronouns and reflexives was significantly impaired compared to the control participants. This comprehension failure was reflected in the aphasic participants' eye movements at sentence end, where fixations to the competitor increased. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that comprehension difficulties with binding constructions seen in agrammatic aphasic patients are not due to a deficit in automatic syntactic processing or delayed processing. Rather, they point to a possible deficit in lexical integration.},

	Abstract = {Individuals with agrammatic Broca's aphasia show deficits in comprehension of non-canonical wh-movement and NP-movement sentences. Previous work using eyetracking has found that agrammatic and unimpaired listeners show very similar patterns of automatic processing for wh-movement sentences. The current study attempts to replicate this finding for sentences with wh-movement (in object relatives in the current study) and to extend it to sentences with NP movement (passives). For wh-movement sentences, aphasic and control participants' eye-movements differed most dramatically in late regions of the sentence and post-offset, with aphasic participants exhibiting lingering attention to a salient but grammatically impermissible competitor. The eye-movement differences between correct and incorrect trials for wh-movement sentences were similar, with incorrect trials also exhibiting competition from an impermissible interpretation late in the sentence. Furthermore, the two groups exhibited similar eye-movement patterns in response to passive NP-movement sentences, but showed little evidence of gap-filling for passives. The results suggest that aphasic and unimpaired individuals may generate similar representations during comprehension, but that aphasics are highly vulnerable to interference from alternative interpretations (Ferreira, 2003).},

	Abstract = {Sentences with non-canonical wh- movement are often difficult for individuals with agrammatic Broca's aphasia to understand (, inter alia). However, the explanation of this difficulty remains controversial, and little is known about how individuals with aphasia try to understand such sentences in real time. This study uses an eyetracking while listening paradigm to examine agrammatic aphasic individuals' on-line comprehension of movement sentences. Participants' eye-movements were monitored while they listened to brief stories and looked at visual displays depicting elements mentioned in the stories. The stories were followed by comprehension probes involving wh- movement. In line with previous results for young normal listeners [Sussman, R. S., \& Sedivy, J. C. (2003). The time-course of processing syntactic dependencies: evidence from eye movements. Language and Cognitive Processes, 18, 143-161], the study finds that both older unimpaired control participants (n=8) and aphasic individuals (n=12) showed visual evidence of successful automatic comprehension of wh- questions (like "Who did the boy kiss that day at school?"). Specifically, both groups fixated on a picture corresponding to the moved element ("who," the person kissed in the story) at the position of the verb. Interestingly, aphasic participants showed qualitatively different fixation patterns for trials eliciting correct and incorrect responses. Aphasic individuals looked first to the moved-element picture and then to a competitor following the verb in the incorrect trials. However, they only showed looks to the moved-element picture for the correct trials, parallel to control participants. Furthermore, aphasic individuals' fixations during movement sentences were just as fast as control participants' fixations. These results are unexpected under slowed-processing accounts of aphasic comprehension deficits, in which the source of failed comprehension should be delayed application of the same processing routines used in successful comprehension. This pattern is also unexpected if aphasic individuals are using qualitatively different strategies than normals to comprehend such sentences, as under impaired-representation accounts of agrammatism. Instead, it suggests that agrammatic aphasic individuals may process wh- questions similarly to unimpaired individuals, but that this process often fails to facilitate off-line comprehension of sentences with wh- movement.},

	Abstract = {We conducted two eye-tracking experiments investigating the processing of the Mandarin reflexive ziji in order to tease apart structurally constrained accounts from standard cue-based accounts of memory retrieval. In both experiments, we tested whether structurally inaccessible distractors that fulfill the animacy requirement of ziji influence processing times at the reflexive. In Experiment 1, we manipulated animacy of the antecedent and a structurally inaccessible distractor intervening between the antecedent and the reflexive. In conditions where the accessible antecedent mismatched the animacy cue, we found inhibitory interference whereas in antecedent-match conditions, no effect of the distractor was observed. In Experiment 2, we tested only antecedent-match configurations and manipulated locality of the reflexive-antecedent binding (Mandarin allows non-local binding). Participants were asked to hold three distractors (animate vs. inanimate nouns) in memory while reading the target sentence. We found slower reading times when animate distractors were held in memory (inhibitory interference). Moreover, we replicated the locality effect reported in previous studies. These results are incompatible with structure-based accounts. However, the cue-based ACT-R model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005) cannot explain the observed pattern either. We therefore extend the original ACT-R model and show how this model not only explains the data presented in this article, but is also able to account for previously unexplained patterns in the literature on reflexive processing.},

@article{burchertetal2012,
	Abstract = {Background: In behavioural tests of sentence comprehension in aphasia, correct and
incorrect responses are often randomly distributed. Such a pattern of chance performance
is a typical trait of Broca's aphasia, but can be found in other aphasic syndromes as well.
Many researchers have argued that chance behaviour is the result of a guessing strategy,
which is adopted in the face of a syntactic breakdown in sentence processing.
Aims: Capitalising on new evidence from recent studies investigating online sentence comprehension
in aphasia using the visual world paradigm, the aim of this paper is to review
the concept of chance performance as a reflection of a syntactic impairment in sentence
processing and to re-examine the conventional interpretation of chance performance as a
guessing behaviour.
Main Contribution: Based on a review of recent evidence from visual world paradigm
studies, we argue that the assumption of chance performance equalling guessing is not
necessarily compatible with actual real-time parsing procedures in people with aphasia.
We propose a reinterpretation of the concept of chance performance by assuming that
there are two distinct processing mechanisms underlying sentence comprehension in
aphasia. Correct responses are always the result of normal-like parsing mechanisms, even
in those cases where the overall performance pattern is at chance. Incorrect responses, on
the other hand, are the result of intermittent deficiencies of the parser. Hence the random
guessing behaviour that persons with aphasia often display does not necessarily reflect a
syntactic breakdown in sentence comprehension and a random selection between alternatives.
Instead it should be regarded as a result of temporal deficient parsing procedures
in otherwise normal-like comprehension routines.
Conclusion: Our conclusion is that the consideration of behavioural offline data alone
may not be sufficient to interpret a performance in language tests and subsequently draw
theoretical conclusions about language impairments. Rather it is important to call on
additional data from online studies that look at language processing in real time in order
to gain a comprehensive picture about syntactic comprehension abilities of people with
aphasia and possible underlying deficits.},

sentence processing.Eyetracking research has addressed a wide range of questions,
such as recovery mechanisms following garden-pathing, the timing of processes
driving comprehension, the role of anticipation and expectation in parsing, the
role of semantic, pragmatic, and prosodic information, and so on. However, there
are some limitations regarding the inferences that can be made on the basis of eye
movements. One relates to the nontrivial interaction between parsing and the eye
movement control system which complicates the interpretation of eye movement
data. Detailed computational models that integrate parsing with eye movement
control theories have the potential to unpack the complexity of eyemovement data
and can therefore aid in the interpretation of eye movements. Another limitation
is the difficulty of capturing spatiotemporal patterns in eye movements using the
traditional word-based eyetracking measures. Recent research has demonstrated
the relevance of these patterns and has shown how they can be analyzed. In this
review, we focus on reading, and present examples demonstrating how eye movement
data reveal what events unfold when the parser runs into difficulty, and how

It remains an open question how the sentence processor interacts with oculomotor control. Using a simple linking hypothesis proposed in Reichle, Warren, and McConnell (2009), we integrated both measures with the eye movement model EMMA (Salvucci, 2001) inside the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2004). We built a reading model that could initiate short ``Time Out 
regressions'' (Mitchell, Shen, Green, & Hodgson, 2008) that compensate for slow postlexical processing. This simple interaction enabled the model to predict the re-reading of words based on parsing difficulty. The model was evaluated in different configurations on the prediction of frequency effects on the Potsdam Sentence Corpus. The extension of EMMA with postlexical processing improved its predictions and reproduced re-reading rates and durations with a reasonable fit to the data.

The present eye-tracking study, which investigated processing of attachment ambiguities of an adjunct in Spanish, suggests that readers sometimes underspecify attachment to save memory resources, consistent with the good-enough account of parsing. Our results confirm a surprising prediction of the good-enough account: high-capacity readers commit to an attachment decision more often than low-capacity participants, leading to more errors and a greater need to reanalyze in garden-path sentences.  These results emerged only when we separated functionally different types of regressive eye movements using a scanpath analysis; conventional eye-tracking measures alone would have led to different conclusions.  The scanpath analysis also showed that rereading was the dominant strategy for recovering from garden-pathing.  Our results may also have broader implications for models of reading processes: reanalysis effects in eye movements occurred late, which suggests that the coupling of oculo-motor control and the parser may not always be as tight as assumed in current computational models of eye movements control in reading.},

	Abstract = {In Persian, a construction exists in which a gap can optionally be replaced by an overt pronoun.  A self-paced reading study (110 participants) suggests that the overt pronoun results in deeper encoding (higher activation) of the antecedent noun, presumably because of richer retrieval cue specifications during antecedent retrieval at the pronoun; this higher activation has the consequence that the antecedent is easier to retrieve at a subsequent stage.  This provides new evidence for reactivation effects of the type assumed in the cue-based retrieval model of parsing (Lewis and Vasishth, 2005), and shows that dependency resolution is not simply a matter of connecting two co-dependents; the retrieval cue specification has a differential impact on processing.},

	Abstract = {Eye-movement research on implicit prosody has found effects of lexical stress on syntactic
ambiguity resolution, suggesting that metrical well-formedness constraints interact
with syntactic category assignment. Building on these findings, the present
eyetracking study investigates whether contextual bias can modulate the effects of
metrical structure on syntactic ambiguity resolution in silent reading. Contextual bias
and potential stress-clash in the ambiguous region were crossed in a 2 × 2 design.
Participants read biased context sentences followed by temporarily ambiguous test
sentences. In the three-word ambiguous region, main effects of lexical stress were
dominant, while early effects of context were absent. Potential stress clash yielded
a significant increase in first-pass regressions and re-reading probability across the
three words. In the disambiguating region, the disambiguating word itself showed
increased processing difficulty (lower skipping and increased re-reading probability)
when the disambiguation engendered a stress clash configuration, while the word
immediately following showed main effects of context in those same measures. Taken
together, effects of lexical stress upon eye movements were swift and pervasive across
first-pass and second-pass measures, while effects of context were relatively delayed.
These results indicate a strong role for implicit meter in guiding parsing, one that
appears insensitive to higher-level constraints. Our findings are problematic for
two classes of models, the two-stage garden-path model and the constraint-based
competition-integration model, but can be explained by a variation on the two-stage
model, the unrestricted race model.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Production of passive sentences is often impaired in agrammatic aphasia and has been attributed both to an underlying structural impairment (e.g., Schwartz, Saffran, Fink, Myers, \& Martin, 1994) and to a morphological deficit (e.g., Caplan \& Hanna, 1998; Faroqi-Shah \& Thompson, 2003). However, the nature of the deficit in passive sentence production is not clear due to methodological issues present in previous studies. AIMS: This study examined active and passive sentence production in nine agrammatic aphasic speakers under conditions of structural priming using eyetracking to test whether structural impairments occur independently of morphological impairments and whether the underlying nature of error types is reflected in on-line measures, i.e., eye movements and speech onset latencies. METHODS \#ENTITYSTARTX00026; PROCEDURES: Nine participants viewed and listened to a prime sentence in either active or passive voice, and then repeated it aloud. Next, a target picture appeared on the computer monitor and participants were instructed to describe it using the primed sentence structure. OUTCOMES \#ENTITYSTARTX00026; RESULTS: Participants made substantial errors in sentence structure, i.e., passives with role reversals (RRs) and actives-for-passives, but few errors in passive morphology. Longer gaze durations to the first-produced noun for passives with RRs as compared to correct passives were found before and during speech. For actives-for-passives, however, this pattern was found during speech, but not before speech. CONCLUSIONS: The deficit in passive sentence production does not solely arise from a morphological deficit, rather it stems, at least in part, from a structural level impairment. The underlying nature of passives with RRs is qualitatively different from that of actives-for-passives, which cannot be clearly differentiated with off-line testing methodology.},

@article{Lee2011,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Speakers with agrammatic aphasia have greater difficulty producing unaccusative (float) compared to unergative (bark) verbs (Kegl, 1995; Lee \& Thompson, 2004; Thompson, 2003), putatively because the former involve movement of the theme to the subject position from the post-verbal position, and are therefore more complex than the latter (Burzio, 1986; Perlmutter, 1978). However, it is unclear if and how sentence production processes are affected by the linguistic distinction between these two types of verbs in normal and impaired speakers. AIMS: This study examined real-time production of sentences with unergative (the black dog is barking) vs unaccusative (the black tube is floating) verbs in healthy young speakers and individuals with agrammatic aphasia, using eyetracking. METHODS \#ENTITYSTARTX00026; PROCEDURES: Participants' eye movements and speech were recorded while they produced a sentence using computer displayed written stimuli (e.g., black, dog, is barking). OUTCOMES \#ENTITYSTARTX00026; RESULTS: Both groups of speakers produced numerically fewer unaccusative sentences than unergative sentences. However, the eye movement data revealed significant differences in fixations between the adjective (black) vs the noun (tube) when producing unaccusatives, but not when producing unergatives for both groups. Interestingly, whereas healthy speakers showed this difference during speech, speakers with agrammatism showed this difference prior to speech onset. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the human sentence production system differentially processes unaccusatives vs unergatives. This distinction is preserved in individuals with agrammatism; however, the time course of sentence planning appears to differ from healthy speakers (Lee \& Thompson, 2010).},

	Abstract = {Recent studies (Dimigen et al., JEP:G, 2011; Kretzschmar et al., NeuroReport, 2009) demonstrated the feasibility of investigating fixation-related potentials (FRPs) and that the results are similar to brain potentials recorded during rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). We conducted an experiment to assess if this correspondence also holds for rhythmic brain activity. To pit our results against results gained with RSVP, the experiment used sentences that are known to produce reliable effects both in the time domain and in the frequency domain (Hagoort, Science, 2004). Participants (N=48) read freely through true ("The Thames flows through London") and false statements ("The Hudson flows through London"). Hagoort et al. report an N400, a negative-going deflection in the ERP with a peak around 400 ms, as well as increased theta (4-7 Hz) and gamma (30-70 Hz) activity. During our experiment, participants' eye movements were monitored and their EEG was recorded from 32 electrodes and later evaluated contingent to the first fixation on the critical word. We analyzed the canonical eye-tracking measures with linear mixed-effects models and the EEG with cluster-permutation tests (Maris & Oostenveld, J Neurosci Methods, 2007) to control for multiple comparisons. As expected, we observed a negativity in the FRP with a centro-parietal distribution and a peak latency of approximately 400 ms. Also as expected, this N400 lined up with increased first fixation durations, gaze durations, and regression rates in the eye movement record (Dambacher & Kliegl, Brain Res, 2007). Crucially, fixation-related power spectra showed synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) at central electrodes and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) at occipito-parietal sites relative to a pre-fixation baseline. None of these effects is reported by Hagoort et al. which suggests that fixation-related EEG changes are at least not fully comparable to those observed in RSVP. One reason for the diverging results could lie in different processing demands: In RSVP, readers must retrieve earlier parts of the sentence from working memory because they cannot make regressions. Increased theta activity reflects this more effortful memory access (Klimesch, Brain Res Rev, 1999). In natural reading, readers can easily move their eyes back to resolve the processing difficulty which facilitates memory access. Our findings question the comparability of results acquired with serial presentation vs. natural reading.},

@article{LogacevMultiple,
	Abstract = {Traxler et al. (1998) found that ambiguous sentences are read faster than their unambiguous counterparts. This so-called ambiguity advantage has presented a major challenge to classical theories of human sentence comprehension (parsing) because its most prominent explanation, in the form of the unrestricted race model (URM), assumes that parsing is non-deterministic. Recently, Swets et al. (2008) have challenged the URM. They argue that readers strategically underspecify the representation of ambiguous sentences to save time, unless disambiguation is required by task demands. When disambiguation is required, however, readers assign sentences full structure --- and Swets et al. provide experimental evidence to this end. On the basis of their findings they argue against the URM and in favor of a model of task-dependent sentence comprehension.
We show through simulations that the Swets et al. data does not constitute evidence for task-dependent parsing because it can be explained by the URM. However, we provide decisive evidence from a German self-paced reading study consistent with Swets et al.'s general claim about task-dependent parsing. Specifically, we show that under certain conditions, ambiguous sentences can be read more slowly than their unambiguous counterparts, suggesting that the parser may create several parses, when required. Finally, we present the first quantitative model of task-driven disambiguation which subsumes the URM, and show that it can explain both Swets et al.'s results and our findings.},

@article{LogacevVasishthQJEP2016,
	Abstract = {Swets et al. (2008) present evidence that the so-called ambiguity advantage (Traxler et al., 1998), which has been explained in terms of the Unrestricted Race Model, can equally well be explained by assuming underspecification in ambiguous conditions driven by task-demands. Specifically, if comprehension questions require that ambiguities be resolved, the parser tends to make an attachment: when questions are about superficial aspects of the target sentence, readers tend to pursue an underspecification strategy. It is reasonable to assume that individual differences in strategy will play a significant role in the application of such strategies, so that studying average behavior may not be informative. In order to study the predictions of the good-enough processing theory, we implemented two versions of underspecification: the partial specification model (PSM), which is an implementation of the Swets et al. proposal, and a more parsimonious version, the non-specification model (NSM). We evaluate the relative fit of these two kinds of underspecification to Swets et al.'s data; as a baseline, we also fit three models that assume no underspecification. We find that a model without unspecification pro- vides a somewhat better fit than both underspecification models, while the NSM model provides a better fit than the PSM. We interpret the results as lack of unambiguous evidence in favor of underspecification; however, given that there is considerable existing evidence for good-enough processing in the literature, it is reasonable to assume that some underspecification might occur. Under this assumption, the results can be interpreted as tentative ev- idence for NSM over PSM. More generally, our work provides a method for choosing between models of real-time processes in sentence comprehension that make qualitative predictions about the relationship between several dependent variables. We believe that sentence processing research will greatly benefit from a wider use of such methods.},

	Abstract = {The psycholinguistic literature has identified two syntactic adaptation effects in language production: rapidly decaying short-term priming and long-lasting adaptation. To explain both effects, we present an ACT-R model of syntactic priming based on a wide-coverage, lexicalized syntactic theory that explains priming as facilitation of lexical access. In this model, two well-established ACT-R mechanisms, base-level learning and spreading activation, account for long-term adaptation and short-term priming, respectively. Our model simulates incremental language production and in a series of modeling studies we show that it accounts for (a)~the inverse frequency interaction; (b)~the absence of a decay in long-term priming; and (c)~the cumulativity of long-term adaptation. The model also explains the lexical boost effect and the fact that it only applies to short-term priming. We also present corpus data that verifies a prediction of the model, i.e., that the lexical boost affects all lexical material, rather than just heads.},

Hagoort et al. reported an N400 effect and synchronization in the theta and gamma range following world knowledge violations. Our first experiment (n = 32) used RSVP and replicated both the N400 effect in the ERPs and the power increase in the theta range in the time--frequency domain. In the second experiment (n = 49), participants read the same materials freely while their eye movements and their EEG were monitored. First fixation durations, gaze durations, and regression rates were increased, and the ERP showed an N400 effect. An analysis of time--frequency representations showed synchronization in the delta range (1--3 Hz) and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11--13 Hz) but no theta or gamma effects. The results suggest that oscillatory EEG changes elicited by world knowledge violations are different in natural reading and RSVP. This may reflect differences in how representations are constructed and retrieved from memory in the two presentation modes.},

Nevertheless, scanpaths have not gained much traction in reading research. One reason for that may have been a lack of suitable analytical tools. Here, we summarize three recent studies in which we used a new scanpath measure to analyze gaze data from two experimental studies (von der Malsburg, Vasishth, 2011, 2012) and one corpus study (von der Malsburg, Kliegl, Vasishth, under revision). The experiments investigated how readers process temporarily ambiguous sentences. We showed that readers do not always commit to one of the alternative interpretations, and that readers with low working-memory capacity do so less often. Contrary to what was reported earlier, we found that reparsing instead of targeted repair is a common strategy to recover from incorrect interpretations. Interestingly, these results did not emerge in an analysis using traditional word-based eyetracking measures showing their limitations. In the corpus study, we demonstrated how syntax, oculomotor constraints, and age of reader jointly determine the regularity of scanpaths. We argue that, taken together, these results establish the scanpath as an informative and tractable object of investigation in reading research.},

Two questions arise from these studies: (1) Are effects observed with fixation-triggered EEG signals comparable to those observed in standard RSVP designs? (2) Does the combined analysis of EEG and fixation data provide additional insights into reading and comprehension processes that are not available with either method alone? Both above-mentioned studies used material known to robustly elicit strong N400 effects. The present study (N=50) examined responses to a more subtle manipulation representative of common experimental designs: we manipulated the distance between anaphoric expressions (pronouns, verb ellipsis) and their antecedents. Differences were examined using a non-parametric Monte Carlo test (Maris & Oostenveld, 2007). Increased distance of the antecedent elicited an early frontocentral negativity in response to verb ellipses (88ms-134ms, p<0.001) and a negativity at frontocentral and parietal electrodes on the words following pronouns (98ms-186ms, p<0.001). We discuss these results in the context of earlier findings and argue that adopting FRP-methodology requires factoring in complex visuomotor contingencies that are not yet fully understood and that evoke ERP effects different from those seen in RSVP designs.},

	Abstract = {There is a wealth of evidence showing that increasing the distance between an argument and its head leads to more processing effort, namely, locality effects; these are usually associated with constraints in working memory (DLT: Gibson, 2000; activation-based model: Lewis and Vasishth, 2005). In SOV languages, however, the opposite effect has been found: antilocality (see discussion in Levy et al., 2013). Antilocality effects can be explained by the expectation-based approach as proposed by Levy (2008) or by the activation-based model of sentence processing as proposed by Lewis and Vasishth (2005). We report an eye-tracking and a self-paced reading study with sentences in Spanish together with measures of individual differences to examine the distinction between expectation- and memory-based accounts, and within memory-based accounts the further distinction between DLT and the activation-based model. The experiments show that (i) antilocality effects as predicted by the expectation account appear only for high-capacity readers; (ii) increasing dependency length by interposing material that modifies the head of the dependency (the verb) produces stronger facilitation than increasing dependency length with material that does not modify the head; this is in agreement with the activation-based model but not with the expectation account; and (iii) a possible outcome of memory load on low-capacity readers is the increase in regressive saccades (locality effects as predicted by memory-based accounts) or, surprisingly, a speedup in the self-paced reading task; the latter consistent with good-enough parsing (Ferreira et al., 2002). In sum, the study suggests that individual differences in working memory capacity play a role in dependency resolution, and that some of the aspects of dependency resolution can be best explained with the activation-based model together with a prediction component.},

	Abstract = {In this chapter, we focus on a previously ignored aspect of sentence processing theories: is processing difficulty caused by reanalysis or competition? According to two-stage theories (e.g., Frazier, 1979; Rayner, Frazier, \{\&\} Carlson, 1983), reanalysis should occur when an initially adopted reading is inappropriate. In contrast, current constraint-based theories (e.g., MacDonald, 1994; McRae, Spivey-Knowlton, \{\&\} Tanenhaus, 1998) claim that processing difficulty is due to a competition between two or more syntactic analyses that are about equally activated. We review a number of eye-tracking experiments investigating this issue. No competition was observed in any of the experiments, thus ruling out current constraint-based theories. In fact, the opposite pattern emerged: sentences that should have produced processing difficulty according to constraint-based theories were actually easier to process than sentences that should not have produced difficulty. The data also turn out to be problematic for two-stage theories, as non-syntactic information appears to be employed before the point of reanalysis. The data provide evidence for a new model of syntactic ambiguity resolution (cf. Traxler, Pickering, \{\&\} Clifton, 1998; Van Gompel, Pickering, \{\&\} Traxler, 1999), the unrestricted race model. In this model, processing difficulty is due to reanalysis, but multiple sources of information can determine which analysis is initially adopted.},

Here, we investigate these effects in the context of sentence processing: targets for retrieval during online sentence processing of English object relative clause constructions differ in the amount of elaboration associated with the target noun phrase, or the homogeneity of superficial features (text color). Experiment 1 shows that greater elaboration for targets during the encoding phase reduces reading times at retrieval sites, but elaboration of non-targets has considerably weaker effects. Experiment 2 illustrates that processing isolated superficial features of target noun phrases---here, a green word in a sentence with words colored white---does not lead to enhanced memory performance, despite triggering longer encoding times. These results are interpreted in the light of the memory models of Nairne, 1990, 2001, 2006, which state that encoding remnants contribute to the set of retrieval cues that provide the basis for similarity-based interference effects.},

	Abstract = {Expectation-driven facilitation (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) and locality-driven retrieval difficulty (Gibson, 1998, 2000; Lewis &
Vasishth, 2005) are widely recognized to be two critical factors in incremental sentence processing; there is accumulating
evidence that both can influence processing difficulty. However, it is unclear whether and how expectations and memory
interact. We first confirm a key prediction of the expectation account: a Hindi self-paced reading study shows that when an
expectation for an upcoming part of speech is dashed, building a rarer structure consumes more processing time than
building a less rare structure. This is a strong validation of the expectation-based account. In a second study, we show that
when expectation is strong, i.e., when a particular verb is predicted, strong facilitation effects are seen when the appearance
of the verb is delayed; however, when expectation is weak, i.e., when only the part of speech ``verb'' is predicted but a
particular verb is not predicted, the facilitation disappears and a tendency towards a locality effect is seen. The interaction
seen between expectation strength and distance shows that strong expectations cancel locality effects, and that weak
expectations allow locality effects to emerge.},

@article{Hanneetal2014,
	Abstract = {Comprehension of non-canonical sentences can be difficult for individuals with aphasia (IWA). It is still unclear to which extent morphological cues like case-marking or verb inflection may influence IWA's performance or even help to override deficits in sentence comprehension. Until now, studies have mainly used offline methods to draw inferences about syntactic deficits and, so far, only a few studies have looked at online syntactic processing in aphasia. We investigated sentence processing in German IWA by combining an offline (sentence-picture matching) and online (eye-tracking in the visual-world paradigm) method. Our goal was to determine whether IWA are capable of using inflectional morphology (number-agreement markers on verbs and case markers in noun phrases) as a cue to sentence interpretation. We report results of two visual-world experiments using German reversible SVO and OVS sentences. In each study, there were eight IWA and 20 age-matched controls. Experiment 1 targeted the role of case-morphology, while Experiment 2 looked at processing of number-agreement cues at the verb in case-ambiguous sentences. IWA showed deficits in using both types of morphological markers as a cue to non-canonical sentence interpretation and the results indicate that in aphasia, processing of case-marking cues is more vulnerable as compared to verb-agreement morphology. However, the online data revealed that IWA are in principle capable of successfully computing morphological cues, but the integration of morphological information is delayed as compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, we found striking differences between controls and IWA regarding subject-before-object parsing predictions. While in case-unambiguous sentences IWA showed evidence for early subject-before-object parsing commitments, they exhibited no straightforward subject-first bias in case-ambiguous sentences, although controls did so for ambiguous structures. IWA delayed their parsing decisions in case-ambiguous sentences until unambiguous morphological information, such as a subject-verb-number-agreement cue, was available. We attribute the differential results for processing of case and agreement markers to differences in the degree of reliability of both morphological cues. We ascribe our findings for erroneous processing of case-unambiguous sentences in aphasia to late parsing commitments and failures in integrating case cues on time. For processing of case-ambiguous sentences in aphasia, we suggest that IWA adopt a wait-and-see strategy and make parsing commitments only when the agreement cue at the verb prompts a particular sentence structure. Our results for IWA further point to deficits in predictive processes during sentence comprehension.},

	Abstract = {We examined the effects of argument-head distance in SVO and SOV languages (Spanish and German), while taking into account readers' working memory capacity and controlling for expectation (Levy, 2008) and other factors. We predicted only locality effects, that is, a slow-down produced by increased dependency distance (Gibson, 2000; Lewis & Vasishth, 2005). Furthermore, we expected stronger locality effects for readers with low working memory capacity. Contrary to our predictions, low-capacity readers showed faster reading with increased distance, while high-capacity readers showed locality effects. We suggest that while the locality effects are compatible with memory-based explanations, the speedup of low-capacity readers can be explained by an increased probability of retrieval failure. We present a computational model based on ACT-R built under the previous assumptions, which is able to give a qualitative account for the present data and can be tested in future research. Our results suggest that in some cases, interpreting longer RTs as indexing increased processing difficulty and shorter RTs as facilitation may be too simplistic: The same increase in processing difficulty may lead to slowdowns in high-capacity readers and speedups in low-capacity ones. Ignoring individual level capacity differences when investigating locality effects may lead to misleading conclusions.},

  word-by-word format (also known as RSVP). Word-by-word presentation

  response to syntactic and semantic violations (N400 and P600

  however, these negativities were only found when the violation

	Abstract = {{\textit{Background}}: Individuals with aphasia (IWA) show deficits in comprehending object-extracted declaratives while comprehension of subject-extracted structures is relatively preserved. It is a matter of debate whether this subject--object asymmetry also arises for comprehension of wh-questions. Successful comprehension of wh-questions critically entails correct resolution of a filler--gap dependency. Most previous studies have used only offline accuracy measures to investigate wh-question comprehension in aphasia. Online studies exploring syntactic processing in real time are needed in order to draw inferences about gap-filling abilities in IWA and to identify the point of breakdown in sentence comprehension.
Aims: This study aimed at investigating processing of subject and object who-questions in German-speaking IWA and in a group of controls by combining an offline and online method. We further aimed to explore the impact of case-marking cues on processing of wh-questions.
Methods & Procedures: Applying a variant of the visual world eye-tracking paradigm, we measured participants' eye movements while they performed the same offline task, which is frequently used to assess comprehension of declaratives (sentence--picture matching).
Outcomes & Results: Concerning online processing of who-questions in controls, we found anticipation of the most likely post-verbal theta-role immediately after processing the case-marked wh-pronoun in both subject and object questions. In addition, we observed an unexpected advantage of object over subject questions in terms of processing time. The offline results for IWA revealed that there were three heterogeneous patterns: (a) symmetrical comprehension with equal impairments for both question types, (b) asymmetrical performance with better comprehension of subject than object who-questions, and (c) a reversed asymmetry with better comprehension of object as compared to subject questions. For online processing of both types of who-questions, IWA showed retained abilities in postulating the gap and in associating the filler with this gap, although they were slower as compared to controls. Moreover, similarly to controls, they anticipated the most likely post-verbal theta-role.
Conclusions: For controls, the findings provide evidence for rapid resolution of the filler--gap dependency and incremental processing of case-marking cues, reflected in early prediction of upcoming syntactic structure. We attribute faster processing of object questions to faster alignment of the anticipated element with a semantically more salient character. For IWA, the online data provide evidence for retained predictive abilities in processing of filler--gap dependencies in wh-questions, but prediction was delayed. This is most likely attributed to delayed integration of case-marking cues.},

	Abstract = {This is the first attempt at characterizing reading difficulty in Hindi using naturally occurring sentences. We created the Potsdam-Allahabad Hindi Eyetracking Corpus by recording eye-movement data from 30 participants at the University of Allahabad, India. The target stimuli were 153 sentences selected from the beta version of the Hindi-Urdu treebank. We find that word- or low-level predictors (syllable length, unigram and bigram frequency) affect first-pass reading times, regression path duration, total reading time, and outgoing saccade length. An increase in syllable length results in longer fixations, and an increase in word unigram and bigram frequency leads to shorter fixations. Longer syllable length and higher frequency lead to longer outgoing saccades. We also find that two predictors of sentence comprehension difficulty, integration and storage cost, have an effect on reading difficulty. Integration cost (Gibson, 2000) was approximated by calculating the distance (in words) between a dependent and head; and storage cost (Gibson, 2000), which measures difficulty of maintaining predictions, was estimated by counting the number of predicted heads at each point in the sentence. We find that integration cost mainly affects outgoing saccade length, and storage cost affects total reading times and outgoing saccade length. Thus, word-level predictors have an effect in both early and late measures of reading time, while predictors of sentence comprehension difficulty tend to affect later measures. This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration using eye-tracking that both integration and storage cost influence reading difficulty.},

	Abstract = {The analysis of experimental data with mixed-effects models requires
decisions about the specification of the appropriate random-effects structure.
Recently, Barr, et al 2013, recommended  fitting `maximal'
models with all possible random effect components included.  Estimation of
maximal models, however, may not converge.  We show that failure to converge
 typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is
a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly
supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum
likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly
informative priors.  Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization
may lead to uninterpretable models.  We provide diagnostic tools for detecting
overparameterization and guiding model simplification.  Finally, we clarify
that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are
atypical for real data.  A detailed example is provided of how subject-related
attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify
statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects
can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.},

	Abstract = {We present a case study demonstrating the importance of Bayesian hierarchical mixture models as a modelling tool for evaluating the predictions of competing theories of cognitive processes. As a case study, we revisit two published data sets from psycholinguistics.
In sentence comprehension, it is widely assumed that the distance between linguistic co-dependents affects the latency of dependency resolution: the longer the distance, the longer the time taken to complete the dependency (e.g., Gibson 2000). An alternative theory, direct access (McElree, 1993), assumes that retrieval times are a mixture of two distributions (Nicenboim & Vasishth, 2017): one distribution represents successful retrievals and the other represents an initial failure to retrieve the correct dependent, followed by a reanalysis that leads to successful retrieval. Here, dependency distance has the effect that in long-distance conditions the proportion of reanalyses is higher. We implement both theories as Bayesian hierarchical models and show that the direct-access model fits the Chinese relative clause reading time data better than the dependency-distance account.
This work makes several novel contributions.
First, we demonstrate how the researcher can reason about the underlying generative process of their data, thereby expressing the underlying cognitive process as a statistical model.
Second, we show how models that have been developed in an exploratory manner to represent different underlying generative processes can be compared in terms of their predictive performance, using both K-fold cross validation on existing data, and using completely new data. Finally, we show how the models can be evaluated using simulated data.},

This paper contends that the theoretical and empirical basis for such approaches is weak. A conceptually simpler alternative is that the processor reprocesses (some portion of) the input using just those structure-building operations available in first-pass parsing. This reprocessing is a necessary component of any realistic processing model. By contrast, the structural revisions required for second-pass repair are more powerful than warranted by the abilities of the first-pass parser. This paper also reviews experimental evidence for repair presented by Sturt, Pickering, and Crocker (1999). We demonstrate that the Sturt et. al. findings are consistent with a reprocessing account and present a self-paced reading experiment intended to tease apart the repair and reprocessing accounts. The results support a reprocessing interpretation of Sturt et. al.'s data, rendering a repair-based explanation superfluous.},

With respect to the relation between shifts of attention and saccadic eye movements, several experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to dissociate the line of attention from the gaze direction. On the other hand, there is some indirect (although not yet conclusive) evidence that saccadic eye movements always produce a concomitant shift of attention. Another question is whether there is a moment-to-moment control of each consecutive saccade and latency or whether indirect control models (i.e. planning several saccades in advance) are more appropriate. The function of attentional processes which have to coordinate stimulus driven (bottom-up) and concept driven (top-down) mechanisms are discussed and related to some studies investigating local and global scanpaths.},

  abstract = {In English, integration of an argument with its head generally leads to slower comprehension at the head (e.g., verb), the more material intervenes between the two. Such “locality” effects have been interpreted as evidence for memory-based comprehension accounts. Most memory-based comprehension accounts are, however, challenged by cases where more intervening material facilitates processing. Such “anti-locality” effects are often interpreted as evidence for expectation-based processing. An alternative interpretation of anti-locality effects within a memory-based account is proposed in (Lewis, Vasishth, \& Van Dyke, 2006): intervening material can lead to repeated retrieval and hence reactivation of dependents. This reactivation can counteract activation-decay and lead to faster retrieval of the dependents at the head. We present new evidence of anti-locality from English relative clauses that existing memory-based accounts, including Lewis et al., 2006, cannot explain. We argue that memory-based and expectation-based models need to be integrated in order to account for the existence of locality and anti-locality effects. We also introduce a two-step mixed effect analysis of reading time data that incorporates controls for several potential confounds common in experiments that investigate locality and anti-locality effects.},

  abstract = {In an eye movement experiment, we examined the use of reanalysis strategies during the reading of locally ambiguous but globally unambiguous Spanish sentences. Among other measures, we examined regressive eye movements made while readers were recovering in reading mild garden path sentences. The sentences had an adverbial clause that, depending on the mood (indicative vs. subjunctive) of the subordinate clause verb, could attach high (to the main verb of the sentence) or low (to the verb in the subordinate clause). Although Spanish speakers favor low attachment, the high attachment version was quite easy to understand. Readers predominately used two alternative strategies to recover from the mild garden path in our sentences. In the more common reanalysis strategy, their eyes regressed from the last region (disambiguation+ 1) directly to the main verb in the sentence. Following this, they reread the rest of the sentence, fixating the next region and the adverb (the beginning of the ambiguous part of the sentence). Less frequently, readers regressed from the last region (disambiguation+1) directly to the adverb. We argue that both types of strategies are consistent with a selective reanalysis process as described by Frazier and Rayner (1982).},

Then we provide an updated version of the model (E-Z Reader 7) and describe how it accounts for basic findings about eye movement control in reading. We then review several alternative models of eye movement control in reading, discussing both their core assumptions and their theoretical scope. On the basis of this discussion, we conclude that E-Z Reader provides the most comprehensive account of eye movement control during reading. Finally, we provide a brief overview of what is known about the neural systems that support the various components of reading, and suggest how the cognitive constructs of our model might map onto this neural architecture.},

Two major accounts of this phenomenon make different predictions about where, in the course of incremental processing of an object relative, difficulty should first appear. An account emphasizing memory processes (Gibson, 1998; Grodner \& Gibson, 2005) predicts difficulty at the relative clause verb, while an account emphasizing experience-based expectations (Hale, 2001; Levy, 2008) predicts earlier difficulty, at the relative clause subject. Two eye movement experiments tested these predictions. Regressive saccades were much more likely from the subject noun phrase of an object relative than from the same noun phrase occurring within a subject relative (Experiment 1) or within a verbal complement clause (Experiment 2). This effect was further amplified when the relative pronoun that was omitted. However, reading time was also inflated on the object relative clause verb in both experiments. These results suggest that the violation of expectations and the difficulty of memory retrieval both contribute to the difficulty of object relative clauses, but that these two sources of difficulty have qualitatively distinct behavioral consequences in normal reading.},

These predictions are tested by analyzing a large corpus of eye movement data from 4 adult readers. The likelihood of regressing is directly related to the length of the prior saccade and to the probability the saccade skipped a word. The likelihood of regressing to a skipped word is influenced by variables that affect the perceptibility of that word. The likelihood of making inter- and intra-word regressions are often affected differently by the variables studied, indicating the importance of maintaining this distinction. The results are generally compatible with a word identification explanation of regressions during reading, though this is probably not the only basis on which regressive saccades occur.},

abstract = {Standard text reading involves frequent eye movements that go against normal reading order. The function of these "regressions" is still largely unknown. The most obvious explanation is that regressions allow for the rereading of previously fixated words. Alternatively, physically returning the eyes to a word's location could cue the reader's memory for that word, effectively aiding the comprehension process via location priming (the "deictic pointer hypothesis"). In Experiment 1, regression frequency was reduced when readers knew that information was no longer available for rereading. In Experiment 2, readers listened to auditorily presented text while moving their eyes across visual placeholders on the screen. Here, rereading was impossible, but deictic pointers remained available, yet the readers did not make targeted regressions in this experiment. In Experiment 3, target words in normal sentences were changed after reading. Where the eyes later regressed to these words, participants generally remained unaware of the change, and their answers to comprehension questions indicated that the new meaning of the changed word was what determined their sentence representations. These results suggest that readers use regressions to reread words and not to cue their memory for previously read words.},

abstract = {The effect of clause wrap-up on eye movements in reading was examined. Readers read passages in which a target category noun referred to either a high typical or a low typical antecedent. In addition, the category noun was either clause final or non-clause final. There were four primary results: (1) Readers looked longer at a category noun when its antecedent was a low typical member of the category than when it was a high typical member; (2) readers looked longer at the category noun and at the post-category region when they were clause final than when they were not clause final; (3) readers regressed from a category noun or post-category region more frequently when it was clause final than when it was not clause final; and (4) readers made longer initial saccades when their eyes left the category noun or post-category region when this word was in clause final position than when it was not clause final. The last result suggests that sometimes higher order processes that are related to making a decision about when to move the eyes impinge on lower level decisions that are typically associated with deciding where to move the eyes.},

In the model, the concept of the visual span (the number of letters that can be identified in a single fixation) plays a key, unifying role. The behavior of the model provides a computational framework for reexamining the literature on human reading saccades. Emergent properties of the model, such as regressive saccades and an optimal-viewing position, suggest new interpretations of human behavior. Because Mr. Chip's "retina" can have any (one-dimensional) arrangement of high-resolution regions and scotomas, the model can simulate common visual disorders. Surprising saccade strategies are linked to the pattern of scotomas. For example, Mr. Chips sometimes plans a saccade that places a decisive letter in a scotoma. This article provides the first quantitative model of the effects of scotomas on reading.},

Mr. Chips is an ideal-observer model that combines these sources of information optimally to read simple texts in the minimum number of saccades. This model provides a computational framework for interpreting human reading saccades in both normal and low vision. The purpose of this paper is to report performance of the model for conditions emulating reading with normal vision––a visual span of nine characters, multiplicative saccade noise with a standard deviation of 30\%, and texts based on three full-length children's books. Comparison of fixation locations by humans and Mr. Chips revealed: (1) that both exhibit very similar word-skipping behavior; (2) both show initial fixations near the center of words, but with a systematic difference suggestive of an asymmetry in the human visual span; and (3) differences in the pattern of refixations within words that may uncover non-optimal lexical inference by human readers. A human context effect––30\% difference in mean saccade size between continuous text and random sequences of words––was very similar to the 25\% effect for the model associated with a corresponding difference in the predictability of text words. Overall, our findings show that many of the complicated aspects of human reading saccades can be explained concisely by early information-processing constraints.},

abstract = {This paper describes an interactive activation model of eye movement control in reading, Glenmore, that can account within one mechanism for preview and spillover effects, for regressions, progressions, and refixations. The model decouples the decision about when to move the eyes from the word recognition process. The time course of activity in a "fixate centre" determines the triggering of a saccade. The other main feature of the model is the use of a saliency map that acts as an arena for the interplay of bottom-up visual features of the text, and top-down lexical features. These factors combine to create a pattern of. activation that selects one word as the saccade target. Even within the relatively simple framework proposed here, a coherent account has been provided for a range of eye movement control phenomena that have hitherto proved problematic to reconcile.},

abstract = {Many comprehension theories assert that increasing the distance between elements participating in a linguistic relation (e.g., a verb and a noun phrase argument) increases the difficulty of establishing that relation during on-line comprehension. Such locality effects are expected to increase reading times and are thought to reveal properties and limitations of the short-term memory system that supports comprehension. Despite their theoretical importance and putative ubiquity, however, evidence for on-line locality effects is quite narrow linguistically and methodologically: It is restricted almost exclusively to self-paced reading of complex structures involving a particular class of syntactic relation. We present 4 experiments (2 self-paced reading and 2 eyetracking experiments) that demonstrate locality effects in the course of establishing subject-verb dependencies; locality effects are seen even in materials that can be read quickly and easily. These locality effects are observable in the earliest possible eye-movement measures and are of much shorter duration than previously reported effects. To account for the observed empirical patterns, we outline a processing model of the adaptive control of button pressing and eye movements. This model makes progress toward the goal of eliminating linking assumptions between memory constructs and empirical measures in favor of explicit theories of the coordinated control of motor responses and parsing.

Currentlymost comprehensive models include sequential shifts of visual attention. Here we propose an alternative model of eye movementcontrol, which includes three new principles: spatially distributed lexical processing, a separation of saccade timing from saccadetarget selection, and autonomous (random) generation of saccades with foveal inhibition. These three features provide a commoncontrol mechanism for fixations, refixations, and regressions. Consequently, the model is called SWIFT (Saccade-generation withinhibition by foveal targets). Results from numerical simulations are in good agreement with effects of word frequency on single-fixation, first-fixation, and gaze durations as well as fixation and word skipping probabilities in first-pass analysis. The modelinherently produces complex eye movement patterns including refixations and regressions due to its underlying dynamical principles.},

abstract = {In 3 experiments, the author examined how readers’ eye movements are influenced by joint manipulations of a word’s frequency and the syntactic fit of the word in its context. In the critical conditions of the first 2 experiments, a high- or low-frequency verb was used to disambiguate a garden-path sentence, while in the last experiment, a high- or low-frequency verb constituted a phrase structure violation. The frequency manipulation always influenced the early eye movement measures of first-fixation duration and gaze duration. The context manipulation had a delayed effect in Experiment 1, influencing only the probability of a regressive eye movement from later in the sentence. However, the context manipulation influenced the same early eye movement measures as the frequency effect in Experiments 2 and 3, though there was no statistical interaction between the effects of these variables. The context manipulation also influenced the probability of a regressive eye movement from the verb, though the frequency manipulation did not. These results are shown to confirm predictions emerging from the serial, staged architecture for lexical and integrative processing of the E–Z Reader 10 model of eye movement control in reading (Reichle, Warren, \& McConnell, 2009). It is argued, more generally, that the results provide an important constraint on how the relationship between visual word recognition and syntactic attachment is treated in processing models. },

This result is consistent with the predictions of several theories (Gibson, 2000; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005), and contradicts the recent claim (Levy, 2008) that in relative-clause structures increasing argument-verb distance makes processing easier at the verb. Levy’s expectation-based account predicts that the expectation for a verb becomes sharper as distance is increased and therefore processing becomes easier at the verb. We argue that, in addition to expectation effects (which are seen in the eyetracking study in first-pass regression probability), processing load also increases with increasing distance. This contradicts Levy’s claim that heightened expectation leads to lower processing cost. Dependency- resolution cost and expectation-based facilitation are jointly responsible for determining processing cost.},

abstract = {This paper presents the cue-based retrieval theory of parsing and reanalysis and illustrates how this account can accommodate a number of key results about parsing and reanalysis, including effects due to structure, distance, and type of structural change. Three offline experiments and one online experiment permit establishing the locus of these effects as due to properties of the initial parsing processes or to the repair mechanism. Specifically, the data reported here suggest that a structural factor specific to the operation of the parser, retrieval interference, affects attachment uniformly across ambiguous and unambiguous sentences and serves to create a limit on successful repair. In addition, these experiments suggest that distance of the head of an ambiguous phrase from its disambiguator affects repair processes-and not attachment processes-independently of the interference effect. These results are interpreted with respect to alternative models of reanalysis, which are contrasted with the cue-based retrieval account, which requires no distinct repair mechanism to account for the current results. A further contribution of this article is to suggest a statistical correction for individual variance in reading rates. Statistical analyses on individual subject data confirmed previous speculations regarding a possible increase in reading rates as subjects move through a sentence. While this individual variation limits fair comparisons of reading times in sentence regions that appear in non-identical serial positions, we demonstrate that such comparisons become meaningful when the appropriate regression analyses have been performed.},

@inproceedings{Patil2011,
abstract = {Phillips, Wagers \& Lau (2009) have claimed that reflexives in English are immune to interference from structurally inaccessible antecedents because antecedents are retrieved using only structural cues without considering the person, gender and number features. The support for this claim is derived from studies (eg. Nicol \& Swinney 1989, Sturt 2003 and Xiang, Dillon, \& Phillips 2009) which found either no effect of interference or a late effect. However, the absence of effect in these studies can be attributed to different factors like lack of statistical power, absence of a critical condition and lack of temporal resolution in the methodology. We present a computational model based on the principles of the cue-based retrieval theory (Lewis \& Vasishth, 2005) which predicts an interference effect in reflexive binding. We also report an eye-tracking study that confirms the predictions. The simulations predict the interference effect in terms of: (i) processing time at the reflexive, which includes antecedent retrieval time and (ii) percentage of errors in the retrieval of the grammatical antecedent for the reflexive. Prediction (ii) matches the error rates in Sturt (2003) and our web-based replication of the same study. In the eye-tracking study (n=40) we found an early effect of interference from the inaccessible antecedent in terms of first-pass regression probability-- a gender match between the reflexive and the inaccessible NP induced a significantly higher (p=0.04) number of first-pass regressions from the reflexive in the sentence. The effect of a gender match with the grammatical antecedent was observed only in late eye-tracking measures. In sum, this work (i) challenges the claim that the antecedent of a reflexive is accessed using only structural cues, and shows that the interference induced by the intervening noun occurs very early during dependency resolution, and (ii) presents an implemented computational model that predicts the interference effect.},

Eye movements in the disambiguating region (by the director) revealed that, in the relative clause biasing contexts, ambiguous reduced relatives were no more difficult to process than unambiguous reduced relatives or full (unreduced) relatives. Regression analyses demonstrated that the effects of discourse context at the point of ambiguity (e.g., selected) interacted with the past participle frequency of the ambiguous verb. Reading times were modeled using a constraint-based competition framework in which multiple constraints are immediately integrated during parsing and interpretation. Simulations suggested that this framework reconciles the superficially conflicting results in the literature on referential context effects on syntactic ambiguity resolution.},

abstract = {When people read temporarily ambiguous sentences, there is often an
increased prevalence of regressive eye-movements launched from the
word that resolves the ambiguity. Traditionally, such regressions
have been interpreted at least in part as reflecting readers’ efforts
to re-read and reconfigure earlier material, as exemplified by the
Selective Reanalysis hypothesis [Frazier, L., \& Rayner, K. (1982).
Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements
in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences. Cognitive Psychology,
14, 178–210]. Within such frameworks it is assumed that the selection
of saccadic landing-sites is linguistically supervised. As an alternative
to this proposal, we consider the possibility (dubbed the Time Out
hypothesis) that regression control is partly decoupled from linguistic
operations and that landing-sites are instead selected on the basis
of low-level spatial properties such as their proximity to the point
from which the regressive saccade was launched. Two eye-tracking
experiments were conducted to compare the explanatory potential of
these two accounts. Experiment 1 manipulated the formatting of linguistically
identical sentences and showed, contrary to purely linguistic supervision,
that the landing site of the first regression from a critical word
was reliably influenced by the physical layout of the text. Experiment
2 used a fixed physical format but manipulated the position in the
display at which reanalysis-relevant material was located. Here the
results showed a highly reliable linguistic influence on the overall
distribution of regression landing sites (though with few effects
being apparent on the very first regression). These results are interpreted
as reflecting mutually exclusive forms of regression control with
fixation sequences being influenced both by spatially constrained,
partially decoupled supervision systems as well as by some kind of
linguistic guidance. The findings are discussed in relation to existing
computational models of eye-movements in reading.},

We present results from three self-paced reading experiments which show that Dutch native speakers also do not show the grammaticality illusion in Dutch, whereas both German and Dutch native speakers do show the illusion when reading English sentences. These findings provide evidence against working memory constraints as an explanation for the observed effect in English. We propose an alternative account based on the statistical patterns of the languages involved. In support of this alternative, a single recurrent neural network model that is trained on both Dutch and English sentences indeed predicts the cross-linguistic difference in grammaticality effect.},

By contrast, expectation-based accounts such as surprisal predict that the less frequent object relative should be harder to process. In previous studies on  Chinese relative clause comprehension, local ambiguities may have rendered a comparison  between relative clause types uninterpretable. We designed experimental materials in which no local ambiguities confound the comparison.

Structure-based accounts assume that the retrieval of the antecedent is guided by syntactic tree-configurational information without considering other kinds of information such as gender marking in the case of English reflexives. By contrast, unconstrained cue-based retrieval assumes that all available information is used for retrieving the antecedent. Similarity-based interference effects from structurally illicit distractors which match a non-structural retrieval cue have been interpreted as evidence favoring the unconstrained cue-based retrieval account since cue-based retrieval interference from structurally illicit distractors is incompatible with the structure-based account. However, it has been argued that the observed effects do not necessarily reflect interference occurring at the moment of retrieval but might equally well be accounted for by interference occurring already at the stage of encoding or maintaining the antecedent in memory, in which case they cannot be taken as evidence against the structure-based account. We present three experiments (self-paced reading and eye-tracking) on German reflexives and Swedish reflexive and pronominal possessives in which we pit the predictions of encoding interference and cue-based retrieval interference against each other. We could not find any indication that encoding interference affects the processing ease of the reflexive-antecedent dependency formation. Thus, there is no evidence that encoding interference might be the explanation for the interference effects observed in previous work. We therefore conclude that invoking encoding interference may not be a plausible way to reconcile interference effects with a structure-based account of reflexive processing.},

Pairs of sentences were presented that differed in syntactic complexity. Patients made more errors and/or took longer in making the plausibility judgments than controls, and were more affected than controls by the syntactic complexity of a sentence in these judgments. Normal subjects showed effects of syntactic structure in self-paced listening. On-line syntactic effects differed in patients as a function of their comprehension level. High-performing patients showed the same effects as normal control subjects; low performing patients did not show the same effects of syntactic structure. On-line syntactic effects also differed in patients as a function of their clinical diagnosis. Broca's aphasic patients' on-line performances suggested that they were not processing complex syntactic structures on-line, while fluent aphasics' performances suggested that their comprehension impairment occurred after on-line processing was accomplished. The results indicate that many aphasic patients retain their ability to process syntactic structure on-line, and that different groups of patients with syntactic comprehension disorders show different patterns of on-line syntactic processing.},

The most obvious explanation is that regressions allow for the rereading of previously fixated words. Alternatively, physically returning the eyes to a word's location could cue the reader's memory for that word, effectively aiding the comprehension process via location priming (the "deictic pointer hypothesis"). In Experiment 1, regression frequency was reduced when readers knew that information was no longer available for rereading. In Experiment 2, readers listened to auditorily presented text while moving their eyes across visual placeholders on the screen. Here, rereading was impossible, but deictic pointers remained available, yet the readers did not make targeted regressions in this experiment. In Experiment 3, target words in normal sentences were changed after reading. Where the eyes later regressed to these words, participants generally remained unaware of the change, and their answers to comprehension questions indicated that the new meaning of the changed word was what determined their sentence representations. These results suggest that readers use regressions to reread words and not to cue their memory for previously read words.},

  abstract      = {Reichle et al. (Psychonomic Bulletin {\&} Review, 2009) proposed two kinds of interaction between post-lexical processing and oculomotor control: (1) "slow integration failure": A time-out regression when post-lexical integration is lagged; and (2) "rapid integration failure": A regression when integration fails. Boston et al. (Eye Movement Research, 2008; Language and Cognitive Processes, 2011) showed that memory retrieval (Lewis {\&} Vasishth, Cognitive Science, 2005) and syntactic surprisal (Hale, NAACL, 2001; Levy, Cognition, 2008) are significant predictors of eye movements in the Potsdam Sentence Corpus. We implemented the proposed interaction of the first kind in the cognitive architecture ACT-R and evaluated the model on the Potsdam Sentence Corpus using pre-calculated values from Boston et al. (2008, 2011). The model's prediction of 11 fixation measures including second-pass durations and regression rates was grouped by classes of word frequency and fitted to the data with a resulting root-mean-square error of 0.206 and a correlation R of 0.9. Based on this evaluation we present work in progress that uses the parser of Lewis {\&} Vasishth (2005) for a direct interaction of eye movement control with parsing rules and implements rapid integration failure resulting in long-range regressions guided by active repair attempts.},

Severalinfluential eye-tracking studies on syntactic reanalysis (Frazier {\&} Rayner, 1982; Meseguer,Carreiras, {\&} Clifton, 2002; Mitchell, Shen, Green, {\&} Hodgson, 2008) have addressed thisquestion by examining scanpaths, i.e., sequential patterns of eye fixations. However, in theabsence of a suitable method for analyzing scanpaths, these studies relied on simplifieddependent measures that are arguably ambiguous and hard to interpret. We address thetheoretical question of repair strategy by developing a new method that quantifiesscanpath similarity. Our method reveals several distinct fixation strategies associated withreanalysis that went undetected in a previously published data set (Meseguer et al., 2002).One prevalent pattern suggests re-parsing of the sentence, a strategy that has beendiscussed in the literature (Frazier {\&} Rayner, 1982); however, readers differedtremendously in how they orchestrated the various fixation strategies. Our results suggestthat the human parsing system non-deterministically adopts different strategies whenconfronted with the disambiguating material in garden-path sentences.},

  abstract      = {Many comprehension theories assert that increasing the distance between elements participating in a
linguistic relation (e.g., a verb and a noun phrase argument) increases the difficulty of establishing that
relation during on-line comprehension. Such locality effects are expected to increase reading times and
are thought to reveal properties and limitations of the short-term memory system that supports comprehension.
Despite their theoretical importance and putative ubiquity, however, evidence for on-line
locality effects is quite narrow linguistically and methodologically: It is restricted almost exclusively to
self-paced reading of complex structures involving a particular class of syntactic relation. We present 4
experiments (2 self-paced reading and 2 eyetracking experiments) that demonstrate locality effects in the
course of establishing subject-verb dependencies; locality effects are seen even in materials that can be
read quickly and easily. These locality effects are observable in the earliest possible eye-movement
measures and are of much shorter duration than previously reported effects. To account for the observed
empirical patterns, we outline a processing model of the adaptive control of button pressing and eye
movements. This model makes progress toward the goal of eliminating linking assumptions between
memory constructs and empirical measures in favor of explicit theories of the coordinated control of
motor responses and parsing.},

distinct difficulty metrics: surprisal, which reflects the change in probabilities
across syntactic analyses as new words are integrated; and retrieval, which
quantifies comprehension difficulty in terms of working memory constraints.We
examine the predictions of both metrics using a family of dependency parsers
indexed by an upper limit on the number of candidate syntactic analyses they
retain at successive words. Surprisal models all fixation measures and regression
probability. By contrast, retrieval does not model any measure in serial
processing. As more candidate analyses are considered in parallel at each word,
retrieval can account for the same measures as surprisal. This pattern suggests an
important role for ranked parallelism in theories of sentence comprehension.},

In the critical conditions of the first 2 experiments, a high- or low-frequency verb was used to disambiguate a garden-path sentence, while in the last experiment, a high- or low-frequency verb constituted a phrase structure violation. The frequency manipulation always influenced the early eye movement measures of first-fixation duration and gaze duration. The context manipulation had a delayed effect in Experiment 1, influencing only the probability of a regressive eye movement from later in the sentence. However, the context manipulation influenced the same early eye movement measures as the frequency effect in Experiments 2 and 3, though there was no statistical interaction between the effects of these variables. The context manipulation also influenced the probability of a regressive eye movement from the verb, though the frequency manipulation did not. These results are shown to confirm predictions emerging from the serial, staged architecture for lexical and integrative processing of the E--Z Reader 10 model of eye movement control in reading (Reichle, Warren, {\&} McConnell, 2009). It is argued, more generally, that the results provide an important constraint on how the relationship between visual word recognition and syntactic attachment is treated in processing models. },

This result is consistent with the predictions of several theories (Gibson, 2000; Lewis and Vasishth, 2005), and contradicts the recent claim (Levy, 2008) that in relative-clause structures increasing argument-verb distance makes processing easier at the verb. Levy's expectation-based account predicts that the expectation for a verb becomes sharper as distance is increased and therefore processing becomes easier at the verb. We argue that, in addition to expectation effects (which are seen in the eyetracking study in first-pass regression probability), processing load also increases with increasing distance. This contradicts Levy's claim that heightened expectation leads to lower processing cost. Dependency- resolution cost and expectation-based facilitation are jointly responsible for determining processing cost.},

One commonly accepted explanation for the English pattern‚{\"A}{\^\i}based on data from offline acceptability ratings and due to Gibson and Thomas (1999)‚{\"A}{\^\i}is that working-memory overload leads the comprehender to forget the prediction of the upcoming verb phrase (VP), which reduces working-memory load. We show that this VP-forgetting hypothesis does an excellent job of explaining the English data, but cannot account for the German results. We argue that the English and German results can be explained by the parser's adaptation to the grammatical properties of the languages; in contrast to English, German subordinate clauses always have the verb in clause-final position, and this property of German may lead the German parser to maintain predictions of upcoming VPs more robustly compared to English. The evidence thus argues against language-independent forgetting effects in online sentence processing; working-memory constraints can be conditioned by countervailing influences deriving from grammatical properties of the language under study.},

A well-known explanation for this preference for ungrammatical structures is based on working-memory overload: the claim is that the prediction for an upcoming verb phrase is forgotten due to memory overload, leading to an illusion of grammaticality (Gibson {\&} Thomas, 1999). How- ever, this memory-overload account cannot explain the recent finding by Vasishth, Suckow, Lewis, and Kern (2008) that in German no illusion of ungrammaticality occurs. We present a simple recurrent network model that can explain both the pres- ence of the grammaticality illusion in English and its absence in German. We argue that the grammaticality illusion emerges as a function of experience with language-specific structures, not working memory constraints as argued for in Gibson and Thomas (1999).},

  abstract = {The ungrammatical sentence "The key to the cabinets are on the table" is known to lead to an illusion of grammaticality. As discussed in the meta-analysis by Jaeger et al., 2017, faster reading times are observed at the verb are in the agreement-attraction sentence above compared to the equally ungrammatical sentence "The key to the cabinet are on the table". One explanation for this facilitation effect is the feature percolation account: the plural feature on cabinets percolates up to the head noun key, leading to the illusion. An alternative account is in terms of cue-based retrieval (Lewis & Vasishth, 2005), which assumes that the non-subject noun cabinets is misretrieved due to a partial feature-match when a dependency completion process at the auxiliary initiates a memory access for a subject with plural marking. We present evidence for yet another explanation for the observed facilitation. Because the second sentence has two nouns with identical number, it is possible that these are, in some proportion of trials, more difficult to keep distinct, leading to slower reading times at the verb in the first sentence above; this is the feature overwriting account of Nairne, 1990. We show that the feature overwriting proposal can be implemented as a finite mixture process. We reanalysed ten published data-sets, fitting hierarchical Bayesian mixture models to these data assuming a two-mixture distribution. We show that in nine out of the ten studies, a mixture distribution corresponding to feature overwriting furnishes a superior fit over both the feature percolation and the cue-based retrieval accounts.},

Simulations show that with a few simple assumptions, the model can account for the fact that effects of higher level language processing are not observed on eye movements when such processing is occurring without difficulty, but can capture the patterns of eye movements that are observed when such processing is slowed or disrupted.},

increased prevalence of regressive eye-movements launched from the
word that resolves the ambiguity. Traditionally, such regressions
have been interpreted at least in part as reflecting readers' efforts
to re-read and reconfigure earlier material, as exemplified by the
Selective Reanalysis hypothesis [Frazier, L., {\&} Rayner, K. (1982).
Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements
in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences. Cognitive Psychology,
14, 178--210]. Within such frameworks it is assumed that the selection
of saccadic landing-sites is linguistically supervised. As an alternative
to this proposal, we consider the possibility (dubbed the Time Out
hypothesis) that regression control is partly decoupled from linguistic
operations and that landing-sites are instead selected on the basis
of low-level spatial properties such as their proximity to the point
from which the regressive saccade was launched. Two eye-tracking
experiments were conducted to compare the explanatory potential of
these two accounts. Experiment 1 manipulated the formatting of linguistically
identical sentences and showed, contrary to purely linguistic supervision,
that the landing site of the first regression from a critical word
was reliably influenced by the physical layout of the text. Experiment
2 used a fixed physical format but manipulated the position in the
display at which reanalysis-relevant material was located. Here the
results showed a highly reliable linguistic influence on the overall
distribution of regression landing sites (though with few effects
being apparent on the very first regression). These results are interpreted
as reflecting mutually exclusive forms of regression control with
fixation sequences being influenced both by spatially constrained,
partially decoupled supervision systems as well as by some kind of
linguistic guidance. The findings are discussed in relation to existing
computational models of eye-movements in reading.},

  abstract      = {A central question in online human sentence comprehension is: how are linguistic
	relations established between different parts of a sentence? Previous work has shown that
	this dependency resolution process can be computationally expensive, but the underlying
	reasons for this are still unclear. We argue that dependency resolution is mediated by
	cue-based retrieval, constrained by independently motivated working memory principles
	defined in a cognitive architecture (ACT-R). To demonstrate this, we investigate an
	unusual instance of dependency resolution, the processing of negative and positive
	polarity items, and confirm a surprising prediction of the cue-based retrieval model:
	partial cue-matches, which constitute a kind of similarity-based interference, can give
	rise to the intrusion of ungrammatical retrieval candidates, leading to both processing
	slow-downs and even errors of judgment that take the form of illusions of grammaticality
	in patently ungrammatical structures. A notable achievement is that good quantitative
	fits are achieved without adjusting the key model parameters.},

	distance can also facilitate processing (Konieczny 2000). We present two self-paced reading
	(SPR) experiments involving Hindi that provide further evidence of antilocality, and a third SPR
	experiment which suggests that similarity-based interference can attenuate this distance-based
	facilitation. A unified explanation of interference, locality, and antilocality effects is proposed
	via an independently motivated theory of activation decay and retrieval interference (Anderson
	et al. 2004).},

		are verydifferent from one another. Yet, graphs showing standard
		error or confidence interval bars aremisleading since these bars
		include the between-subject variability. Loftus and Masson (1994)noticed
		this fact and proposed an alternate method to compute the error bars.
		However, i) theirapproach requires that the ANOVA be performed first,
		which is paradoxical since a graph is anaid to decide whether to
		perform analyses or not; ii) their method provides a single error
		bar forall the conditions, masking information such as the heterogeneity
		of variances across conditions;iii) the method proposed is difficult
		to implement in commonly-used graphing software. Herewe propose a
		simple alternative and sow how it can be implemented in SPSS.},

In this article, we first review what is known about eye movements during reading. Then we provide an updated version of the model (E-Z Reader 7) and describe how it accounts for basic findings about eye movement control in reading. We then review several alternative models of eye movement control in reading, discussing both their core assumptions and their theoretical scope. On the basis of this discussion, we conclude that E-Z Reader provides the most comprehensive account of eye movement control during reading. Finally, we provide a brief overview of what is known about the neural systems that support the various components of reading, and suggest how the cognitive constructs of our model might map onto this neural architecture.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents the cue-based retrieval theory of parsing and reanalysis and illustrates how this account can accommodate a number of key results about parsing and reanalysis, including effects due to structure, distance, and type of structural change. Three offline experiments and one online experiment permit establishing the locus of these effects as due to properties of the initial parsing processes or to the repair mechanism. Specifically, the data reported here suggest that a structural factor specific to the operation of the parser, retrieval interference, affects attachment uniformly across ambiguous and unambiguous sentences and serves to create a limit on successful repair. In addition, these experiments suggest that distance of the head of an ambiguous phrase from its disambiguator affects repair processes-and not attachment processes-independently of the interference effect. These results are interpreted with respect to alternative models of reanalysis, which are contrasted with the cue-based retrieval account, which requires no distinct repair mechanism to account for the current results. A further contribution of this article is to suggest a statistical correction for individual variance in reading rates. Statistical analyses on individual subject data confirmed previous speculations regarding a possible increase in reading rates as subjects move through a sentence. While this individual variation limits fair comparisons of reading times in sentence regions that appear in non-identical serial positions, we demonstrate that such comparisons become meaningful when the appropriate regression analyses have been performed.},

Currentlymost comprehensive models include sequential shifts of visual attention. Here we propose an alternative model of eye movementcontrol, which includes three new principles: spatially distributed lexical processing, a separation of saccade timing from saccadetarget selection, and autonomous (random) generation of saccades with foveal inhibition. These three features provide a commoncontrol mechanism for fixations, refixations, and regressions. Consequently, the model is called SWIFT (Saccade-generation withinhibition by foveal targets). Results from numerical simulations are in good agreement with effects of word frequency on single-fixation, first-fixation, and gaze durations as well as fixation and word skipping probabilities in first-pass analysis. The modelinherently produces complex eye movement patterns including refixations and regressions due to its underlying dynamical principles.},

Mr. Chips is an ideal-observer model that combines these sources of information optimally to read simple texts in the minimum number of saccades. This model provides a computational framework for interpreting human reading saccades in both normal and low vision. The purpose of this paper is to report performance of the model for conditions emulating reading with normal vision----a visual span of nine characters, multiplicative saccade noise with a standard deviation of 30\%, and texts based on three full-length children's books. Comparison of fixation locations by humans and Mr. Chips revealed: (1) that both exhibit very similar word-skipping behavior; (2) both show initial fixations near the center of words, but with a systematic difference suggestive of an asymmetry in the human visual span; and (3) differences in the pattern of refixations within words that may uncover non-optimal lexical inference by human readers. A human context effect----30\% difference in mean saccade size between continuous text and random sequences of words----was very similar to the 25\% effect for the model associated with a corresponding difference in the predictability of text words. Overall, our findings show that many of the complicated aspects of human reading saccades can be explained concisely by early information-processing constraints.},

The model decouples the decision about when to move the eyes from the word recognition process. The time course of activity in a "fixate centre" determines the triggering of a saccade. The other main feature of the model is the use of a saliency map that acts as an arena for the interplay of bottom-up visual features of the text, and top-down lexical features. These factors combine to create a pattern of. activation that selects one word as the saccade target. Even within the relatively simple framework proposed here, a coherent account has been provided for a range of eye movement control phenomena that have hitherto proved problematic to reconcile.},

In part one, participants listened to sentences containing two, three, four, or five clauses, and were asked questions about the content of the sentences. The results of part one demonstrate that an important unit of representation in sentence memory is the clause, and not some other component of discourse structure. In part two, the same group of participants performed eight different short-term storage/working memory tasks. A composite complex span score was computed for each participant based on three working memory tasks closely based on Daneman $\backslash${\&} Carpenter's (1980) reading span task. This working memory measure was significantly correlated with the participants' performance on the sentence memory task in part one. A second working memory measure‚\"{A}\^{\i}N-back‚\"{A}\^{\i}was also significantly correlated with the participants' performance on the sentence memory task, and there was no correlation between their performance on the complex span task and the N-back task. It is therefore concluded that (i) working memory consists of a number of dissociable components; and (ii) memory for sentences taps into more than one of these working memory components. Furthermore, the high correlations of sentence memory with the complex span and the N-back tasks (neither of which are language processing tasks) suggests that memory for sentences is not simply a result of linguistic experience; rather, it is likely that an independent working memory component contributes to participants' performance on the sentence memory task.},

	more difficulty when semantic information disambiguated the sentences

	Spivey-Knowlton, & Seidenberg, 1998; Spivey-Knowlton & Sedivy, 1995)

	Pickering, & Clifton, 1998).},

Readers read passages in which a target category noun referred to either a high typical or a low typical antecedent. In addition, the category noun was either clause final or non-clause final. There were four primary results: (1) Readers looked longer at a category noun when its antecedent was a low typical member of the category than when it was a high typical member; (2) readers looked longer at the category noun and at the post-category region when they were clause final than when they were not clause final; (3) readers regressed from a category noun or post-category region more frequently when it was clause final than when it was not clause final; and (4) readers made longer initial saccades when their eyes left the category noun or post-category region when this word was in clause final position than when it was not clause final. The last result suggests that sometimes higher order processes that are related to making a decision about when to move the eyes impinge on lower level decisions that are typically associated with deciding where to move the eyes.},

Mr. Chips is an ideal-observer model that combines these sources of information optimally to read simple texts in the minimum number of saccades. In the model, the concept of the visual span (the number of letters that can be identified in a single fixation) plays a key, unifying role. The behavior of the model provides a computational framework for reexamining the literature on human reading saccades. Emergent properties of the model, such as regressive saccades and an optimal-viewing position, suggest new interpretations of human behavior. Because Mr. Chip's "retina" can have any (one-dimensional) arrangement of high-resolution regions and scotomas, the model can simulate common visual disorders. Surprising saccade strategies are linked to the pattern of scotomas. For example, Mr. Chips sometimes plans a saccade that places a decisive letter in a scotoma. This article provides the first quantitative model of the effects of scotomas on reading.},

In accord with the garden-path theory of sentence comprehension, shorter reading times were found for sentences conforming to certain independently motivated parsing strategies (late closure and minimal attachment) than for comparable sentences which violate these strategies. Further, longer fixation durations were associated with the very first fixation in the region of the sentence which disambiguated the sentence, suggesting that the human sentence-parsing mechanism operates in a rather systematic fashion, immediately computing the structural consequences of fixated material for the analysis of preceding material. The pattern of regressive eye movements did not conform to the view that the parsing mechanism automatically returns to the beginning of the sentence to revise an incorrect analysis of linguistic material nor did it support the view that the parsing mechanism systematically backtracks through the sentence until the source of the erroneous analysis is located. Rather, the pattern of regressions indicated that the parsing mechanism typically engages in selective reanalysis, exploiting whatever information it has available about the type of error it has committed to guide its reanalysis attempts. Finally, it is emphasized that an understanding of the parser's revision procedures is essential to an explanation of why certain linguistic structures cannot be successfully parsed by humans.},

  abstract   = {Linguistic illusions have provided valuable insights into how we mentally navigate complex representations in memory during language comprehension. Two notable cases involve illusory licensing of agreement and negative polarity items (NPIs), where comprehenders fleetingly accept sentences with unlicensed agreement or an unlicensed NPI, but judge those same sentences as unacceptable after more reflection. Existing accounts have argued that illusions are a consequence of faulty memory access processes, and make the additional assumption that the encoding of the sentence remains fixed over time. This paper challenges the predictions made by these accounts, which assume that illusions should generalize to a broader set of structural environments and a wider range of syntactic and semantic phenomena. We show across seven reading-time and acceptability judgment experiments that NPI illusions can be reliably switched ``on'' and ``off'', depending on the amount of time from when the potential licensor is processed until the NPI is encountered. But we also find that the same profile does not extend to agreement illusions. This contrast suggests that the mechanisms responsible for switching the NPI illusion on and off are not shared across all illusions. We argue that the contrast reflects changes over time in the encoding of the semantic/pragmatic representations that can license NPIs. Just as optical illusions have been informative about the visual system, selective linguistic illusions are informative not only about the nature of the access mechanisms, but also about the nature of the encoding mechanisms.},

  abstract  = {Phillips, Wagers \& Lau (2009) have claimed that reflexives in English are immune to interference from structurally inaccessible antecedents because antecedents are retrieved using only structural cues without considering the person, gender and number features. The support for this claim is derived from studies (eg. Nicol \& Swinney 1989, Sturt 2003 and Xiang, Dillon, \& Phillips 2009) which found either no effect of interference or a late effect. However, the absence of effect in these studies can be attributed to different factors like lack of statistical power, absence of a critical condition and lack of temporal resolution in the methodology. We present a computational model based on the principles of the cue-based retrieval theory (Lewis \& Vasishth, 2005) which predicts an interference effect in reflexive binding. We also report an eye-tracking study that confirms the predictions. The simulations predict the interference effect in terms of: (i) processing time at the reflexive, which includes antecedent retrieval time and (ii) percentage of errors in the retrieval of the grammatical antecedent for the reflexive. Prediction (ii) matches the error rates in Sturt (2003) and our web-based replication of the same study. In the eye-tracking study (n=40) we found an early effect of interference from the inaccessible antecedent in terms of first-pass regression probability-- a gender match between the reflexive and the inaccessible NP induced a significantly higher (p=0.04) number of first-pass regressions from the reflexive in the sentence. The effect of a gender match with the grammatical antecedent was observed only in late eye-tracking measures. In sum, this work (i) challenges the claim that the antecedent of a reflexive is accessed using only structural cues, and shows that the interference induced by the intervening noun occurs very early during dependency resolution, and (ii) presents an implemented computational model that predicts the interference effect.},

We conducted an experiment to see if this correspondence also holds for oscillatory brain dynamics. Participants (N=48) read true ("The Thames flows through London") and false factual statements ("The Hudson flows through London"). Such violations are known to elicit an N400, a negative-going deflection with a peak around 400 ms, and increased theta and gamma activity (Hagoort, Science, 2004). As expected, we see an N400 in the FRP and increased fixation durations and regression rates in the eye movement record. Moreover, a cluster-permutation test (Maris & Oostenveld, J Neurosci Methods, 2007) for fixation-related power spectra shows synchronization in the delta range (1-3 Hz) and desynchronization in the upper alpha range (11-13 Hz) but no theta or gamma effects. This is at odds with prior findings and suggests that fixation-related oscillatory EEG changes are not fully comparable to those observed in RSVP. One reason for the diverging results may lie in different processing demands: In RSVP, readers must retrieve earlier parts of the sentence from memory because they cannot make regressions.},

  abstract = {To examine the nature of the information that guides eye movements to previously read text during reading (regressions), we used a relatively novel technique to request a regression to a particular target word when the eyes reached a predefined location during sentence reading. A regression was to be directed to a close or a distant target when either the first or the second line of a complex two-line sentence was read. In addition, conditions were created that pitted effects of spatial and linguistic distance against each other. Initial regressions were more accurate when the target was spatially near, and effects of spatial distance dominated effects of verbal distance. Initial regressions rarely moved the eyes onto the target, however, and subsequent "corrective' regressions that homed in on the target were subject to general linguistic processing demands, being more accurate during first-line reading than during second-line reading. The results suggest that spatial and verbal memory guide regressions in reading. Initial regressions are primarily guided by fixation-centered spatial memory, and corrective regressions are primarily guided by linguistic knowledge.},
  annote   = {From Duplicate 1 ( Long-range regressions to previously read words are guided by spatial and verbal memory - Weger, U W; Inhoff, Albrecht ) Regressions do not produce the experience of a "word salad", even though the temporal order of words is mixed up. Readers are often not even aware of having regressed. -> Inconsistencies between temporal and spatial word order need to be resolved. [Or: Temporal order needs to be ignored while spatial order is perceived.] Kennedy et al. (2003): Exp Readers were asked a question about a sentence which either remained on the screen durng the question or not. In 13\% and 50\% of the trials respectively, readers regressed *toward* the relevant word. In both conditions, *if* a regression was executed, the eyes moved ver close to the target word. [I hope this does not mean that they re-read the sentence] => Readers have a spatial memory for words. But could be verbal, too. Inhoff \{\&\} Weger (2005): Similar results, but regressions were quite imprecise, and precision was less accurate when the distance was longer. Again the data is compatible with coarse spatial info or location reconstruction based on verbal info. EXPERIMENT 1: Gaze-contingent speech-technique: Participants hear an already read word while reading a follow-up word. They have to move their gaze back to the word the hear. Sentences to-be-read extended over two lines. In half of the conditions [Subexp 1], regessions were initiated from the end of the first or second line, and the distance to the target was manipulated. Conditions: * Regression distance (long/short) x Regression domain (first/second line) PREDICTIONS: (Very questionable predictions) * If verbal knowledge is used to infer location, accuracy should be lower on the second line, due to higher "verbal load", and thus higher interference. There should be no difference if spatial coordinates are stored, because they are much more implicit. They relate it to a Miyake et al. (1994) paper, which seems to discuss something along the lines of digging in effects. [I guess I agree with the general idea of storage=spatial vs. reconstruction=verbal. Higher load+reconstruction should really lead to worse performance.] In another half of the conditions [Subexp 2], regressions were started from the beginning of the second line. Verbal and spatial distance were dissociated, or rather always mismatched. Sometimes the first line was masked with random characters, before the probe was presented. Conditons: * spatial close, verbal far \{\&\} spatial far, verbal close x mask/no mask RESULTS: - Measures of interest: Regression size and (absolute) accuracy. Regression Size: * Initial Regressions: Main effect of distance (longer saccades with increasing distance), but no effect of line and no interaction. * Cumulative Regressions: Main effect of distance, and interaction between distance and line. The interaction is caused by a larger effect of distance in the first line. ==> No effect in initial but then an effect in cumulative size. According to W\{\&\}I there is spatial adressing, but then finer verbal guidance. Regression Accuracy: * Initial Regressions: Main effect of distance, and marginal main effect of line: Accuracy slightly higher in first line than second line (p=.08). No interaction. * Cumulative Regressions: Main effect of distance, main effect of line (better accuracy in first line.) No interaction.

Sentences to-be-read extended over two lines. In half of the conditions [Subexp 1], regessions were initiated from the end of the first or second line, and the distance to the target was manipulated. Conditions: * Regression distance (long/short) x Regression domain (first/second line) PREDICTIONS: (Very questionable predictions) * If verbal knowledge is used to infer location, accuracy should be lower on the second line, due to higher "verbal load", and thus higher interference. There should be no difference if spatial coordinates are stored, because they are much more implicit. They relate it to a Miyake et al. (1994) paper, which seems to discuss something along the lines of digging in effects. [I guess I agree with the general idea of storage=spatial vs. reconstruction=verbal. Higher load+reconstruction should really lead to worse performance.] In another half of the conditions [Subexp 2], regressions were started from the beginning of the second line. Verbal and spatial distance were dissociated, or rather always mismatched. Sometimes the first line was masked with random characters, before the probe was presented. Conditons: * spatial close, verbal far \{\&\} spatial far, verbal close x mask/no mask RESULTS: - Measures of interest: Regression size and (absolute) accuracy. Regression Size: * Initial Regressions: Main effect of distance (longer saccades with increasing distance), but no effect of line and no interaction. * Cumulative Regressions: Main effect of distance, and interaction between distance and line. The interaction is caused by a larger effect of distance in the first line. ==> No effect in initial but then an effect in cumulative size. According to W\{\&\}I there is spatial adressing, but then finer verbal guidance. Regression Accuracy: * Initial Regressions: Main effect of distance, and marginal main effect of line: Accuracy slightly higher in first line than second line (p=.08). No interaction. * Cumulative Regressions: Main effect of distance, main effect of line (better accuracy in first line.) No interaction.},
